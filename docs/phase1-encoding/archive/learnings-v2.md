---

## Title Positioning
- "King Herod" → "Herod the king" — title after name (Mt 2:1)
- "Simon the tanner" — not "the tanner Simon" (Ac 10:6)
- Pattern: "[Name] the [title]" not "[Title] [Name]"

## Indirect Questions
- "asked where X" → "asked about the place [that X happened in]" (Mt 2:4)
- "when/where" cannot be relativizers directly
- Use "the time/place [that...]" structure

## L2 Word Substitutions
- "region" → "area" (Mt 2:6)
- "teachers" → "leaders" (Mt 2:4)
- "disturbed" → "afraid" (Mt 2:3)

## Quote Structure
- Complex nested quotes may exceed linter capacity (Mt 2:2, 2:8, 2:9)
- Consider splitting or simplifying quote structures

## Possessive Pronouns
- "their way" → restructure to avoid possessive (Mt 2:9)
- Pattern: eliminate possessive pronouns where possible
- For family: "that man's wife/sons" is clearer than "the wife of that man" (Ru 1:1)

## Hyphenated Verbs (Phrasal Verbs)
- went-up, gone-up, bring-back — always base form, hyphenated (Ac 10:9)
- CAUTION: "[in-order-to" vs "[in order to" — prefer spaced brackets for multi-word conjunctions (Ru 1:1)

## Nested Brackets
- Successfully handled: `[in-order-to bring-back... [who people call Peter]]` (Ac 10:5)

## Command Verb Patterns
- "command [that I do X]" → REJECTED by ontology (Tit 1:3)
- Need alternative: "order [AGENT to VERB]"
- Gap for divine commissioning patterns

## L2 Pairings for Epistles
- leader/apostle (Tit 1:1)
- say/proclaim (Tit 1:3)
- set-apart/holy (Tit 1:8)

## Named Entity Pattern
- "a man named Jesus Christ" (Tit 1:1)
- "a place named Crete" (Tit 1:5)

## Theta Grid Warnings
- "be-Y" and "make-D" have no theta grid info — system limitations, not errors (Phm 1:6)

## Epistle Greeting Patterns
- Multi-recipient: repeat "greet" verb for each (Phm 1:1)
- "dear friend" → "friend" — remove "dear" (Phm 1:1)

## Genre Complexity
- Epistles are much harder than narrative
- Dense theological language causes many more errors (Tit 1:1-9)

## Verb Argument Ordering
- "send" — patient immediately follows: "sent X to Y" not "sent to Y X" (Mt 2:8)
- "learn" — patient required: "learned X from Y" not "learned from Y" (Mt 2:7)
- "born" — passive triggers agent errors; prefer active/future: "will be king" not "was born king" (Mt 2:2)

## Narrative Structure
- Use `(title)` marker at narrative section starts (Jon 1:1)
- Use "One day" opener for narrative beginnings (Jon 1:1)
- "decided [to verb]" for intent/purpose (Jon 1:3)

## Causative Constructions
- "caused [X to verb]" for divine actions on nature (Jon 1:4)

## Vocabulary Patterns
- "heavy things" not "cargo" for ship goods (Jon 1:5)
- "leader of the ship" not "captain" (Jon 1:6)
- "Perhaps" not "Maybe" for possibility (Jon 1:6)
- "men [who worked on that ship]" for sailors (Jon 1:5)

## Geographic Names
- Name seas explicitly: "Mediterranean Sea" (Jon 1:4)

## Implicit Markers (He1)
- Use `(implicit-info)` for implicit information (Jon 1:5)

## Famine/Scarcity Expression
- "there was a famine" → "many people [who were living in X] did not have enough food" (Ru 1:1)
- Use active subject with relative clause, not existential "there was"

## Determiner Patterns
- First mention of specific individual: "A certain man" (Ru 1:1)
  - ERROR: Evidence approach produced "one man" which differs from policy "A certain man" (Ru 1:1)
  - Policy takes priority over evidence for determiners
- Subsequent reference: "That man" not "the man" (Ru 1:1)

## Title Clause Names
- Title clause may use character names from later verses (Ru 1:1)
- Pattern: `Name (title) and Name verb from Place to Place.` (Ru 1:1)

## Speech Introduction
- Add `(implicit-info) walked to X` before speech when motion implicit (Ru 2:8)

## Relative Clause Relativizers
- Use "that" for people in He1, not "who": "women [that work for...]" (Ru 2:8)

## State Changes
- "become thirsty" not "are thirsty" for state changes (Ru 2:9)

## Object Vocabulary
- "containers" not "jars" for water vessels (Ru 2:9)

## Indirect Commands
- "told [X to not verb Y]" structure for reported commands (Ru 2:9)

- "[just like X verbs Y]" then separate explanation sentence (Ru 2:12)

## Section Markers
- `_paragraph` at section starts (Ac 16:25)

## Dual Translations
- "(complex)/(simple)" for difficult concepts (Ac 16:26)

## Implicit Agents
- `_implicitActiveAgent` for passive agents (Ac 16:26)
- "opened by this event" - event as agent (Ac 16:26)

## Role Descriptions
- "the man [who was responsible for the prisoners]" for jailer (Ac 16:27)

## Causal Connectors
- "For" instead of "Because" at sentence start (Ac 16:27)

## Request Structure
- "asked-B [X to bring Y]" for requests (Ac 16:29)

## Posture Verbs
- "knelt in front of" not "fell before" (Ac 16:29)

## Movement Verbs
- "led...from that room" not "brought out" (Ac 16:30)

## Title/Honorific L2
- "Masters-B/lords" for "Sirs" (Ac 16:30)

- "which things-B" not "what" (Ac 16:30)

## Section Titles
- Use `(title)` marker at section start: `Ruth (title) meets Boaz.` (Ru 2:1)
- Pattern: `{Character} (title) {action summary}.`

## Implicit-Info Markers (Narrative)
- Use `(implicit-info)` for inferable facts: `Boaz (implicit-info) lived in Bethlehem.` (Ru 2:1)

## Let-Request Structure
- "Let me go" → `(imp) let [me(X) go to Y]` NOT `I(X) will go` (Ru 2:2)

## Question Inversion (Belonging)
- "Who does X belong to?" → `["X belongs to which person?"]` (Ru 2:5)

## Title Format (OT)
- OT narrative: `-Title X.` NOT `(title) X` (Gen 22:1)

## Deity Naming
- Genesis uses `God` (Elohim) not `Yahweh` (Gen 22:1)
- Only `Yahweh` when NIV has "LORD" (all caps)

## Call/Response Pattern
- "called X" → `seek-attention X. and X give-attention to Y.` (Gen 22:1)

## Sacrifice Vocabulary
- Explicit: `kill X` + `burn the body of X` (Gen 22:2)

## Hyphenated Verbs (CRITICAL)
- ALWAYS base form: `pick-up`, `go-up` (1Sa 17:40)
