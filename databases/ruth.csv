RUT,1,1,"Elimelech (title) and Naomi move from Bethlehem to Moab.  [When judges were ruling Israel] many people [who were living in Israel] did not have enough food. A certain man was from Bethlehem [which was in Judah]. That man, that man's wife, and that man's two sons moved from Bethlehem to a country named Moab [in order to live in Moab for a few years]. "
RUT,1,2,"That man's name was Elimelech.  And that man's wife's name was Naomi.  One son's name was Mahlon. And the other son's name was Kilion. Elimelech and Naomi were in Ephrah's family/clan.  That family was living in a town named Bethlehem [which was in Judah]. But that family went to a country named Moab. And that family lived in Moab."
RUT,1,3,"Elimelech [who was Naomi's husband] died later. So Naomi lived with only Naomi's two sons."
RUT,1,4,"Naomi's sons grew up. And Naomi's sons became men. Then these sons married women [that were from Moab]. One son married a woman named Orpah. The other son married a woman named Ruth. [after Naomi's sons married women], Naomi lived in Moab for ten years with Naomi's sons."
RUT,1,5,"Then Mahlon and Kilion also died. So Naomi was alone. Naomi did not have Naomi's husband or Naomi's sons."
RUT,1,6,"[while Naomi was living in Moab] a person told Naomi [that God was caring for God's people in Bethlehem]. God had given food to those people. So Naomi prepared [to return to Bethlehem]. Naomi's daughters-in-law also prepared [to return to Bethlehem with Naomi]."
RUT,1,7,"Then Naomi and Naomi's daughters-in-law left the place [that Naomi and Naomi's daughters-in-law were living in]. And Naomi and Naomi's daughters-in-law started walking on the road [that led to Judah]. "
RUT,1,8,"But Naomi said to Naomi's daughters in law, [""My(Naomi's) daughters, you(daughters in law) must return to Moab]. You(daughters in law) (imp) return to the houses of your(daughters in law's) mothers. I(Naomi) hope [that Yahweh will care for you(daughters in law) [like you(daughters in law) cared for me(Naomi) and my(Naomi's) sons]]."
RUT,1,9,"I(Naomi) hope [that Yahweh will give peace to you(daughters in law) [by giving new husbands to you(daughters in law)]]."" Then Naomi kissed Naomi's daughters in law. Then the daughters in law cried loudly."
RUT,1,10,"Naomi's daughters in law said to Naomi, [""We(daughters in law) want [to go to your(Naomi's) people with you(Naomi)]]."""
RUT,1,11,"But Naomi said, [""No]. My(Naomi's) daughters, you(daughters) (imp) return to your(daughters in law's) houses. You(daughters) (imp) do not come with me(Naomi). I(Naomi) will not be able [to care for you(daughters in law)]. I(Naomi) will not be able [to give new husbands to you(daughters in law)] [because I(Naomi) will not be able [to give birth to more sons]]."
RUT,1,12,"So you(daughters in law) should return to the houses of your(daughters in law's) parents. I(Naomi) am not able [to marry another man] [because I(Naomi) am too old]. [even if I(Naomi) marry a man tonight] [and if I(Naomi) were to give birth to sons] you(daughters in law) would not be able [to wait [for those sons to grow up]]. No person will care for you(daughters in law) [while those sons grow up]."
RUT,1,13,"I(Naomi) am very sad  [because Yahweh caused [me(Naomi) to be sad]].""  [if you(daughters in law) come with me(Naomi)] you(daughters in law) also will be very sad."
RUT,1,14,"Naomi's daughters in law cried again. Then Orpah kissed Naomi. And Orpah goodbye Naomi. Then Orpah returned to Moab. But Ruth refused [to leave Naomi]."
RUT,1,15,"Naomi said to Ruth, [""Orpah will return to Orpah's people and to Orpah's gods]. You(Ruth) should also return to your(Ruth's) people."""
RUT,1,16,"But Ruth said to Naomi, [""You(Naomi) (imp) do not tell [me(Ruth) to leave you(Naomi)]]. You(Naomi) (imp) allow [me(Ruth) to follow you(Naomi)]. [if you(Naomi) travel to a place] I(Ruth) will also travel to that place. [if you(Naomi) live in a place] I(Ruth) will also live in that place. I(Ruth) will live with your(Naomi's) people. And I(Ruth) will worship your(Naomi's) God."
RUT,1,17,"I(Ruth) will die at the place [that you(Naomi) will die]. I(Ruth) will be buried at that place by people. I(Ruth) swear to Yahweh [that I(Ruth) will stay with you(Naomi)] [until I(Ruth) die]. [if I(Ruth) do not keep this promise] I(Ruth) will ask [Yahweh to punish me(Ruth)]."""
RUT,1,18,"So Naomi stopped arguing with Ruth. Naomi understood [that Ruth would not return to the house of Ruth's parents]."
RUT,1,19,"So Naomi and Ruth traveled to Bethlehem. [when Naomi and Ruth entered Bethlehem] the people [that lived in Bethlehem] became excited. The women [that lived in Bethlehem] asked each-other(women), [""Is this woman Naomi]?"""
RUT,1,20,"But Naomi said to the people, [""You(people) (imp) do not call me(Naomi) Naomi]. You(people) (imp) call me(Naomi) Mara [because Yahweh caused [me(Naomi) to be sad]]."" Naomi means happy. But Mara means sad."
RUT,1,21,"Naomi said, [""[when I(Naomi) left Bethlehem] I(Naomi) had many things]. But Yahweh took those things from me(Naomi). So You(people) (imp) do not call me(Naomi) Naomi [because Yahweh caused [me(Naomi) to suffer]]."""
RUT,1,22,"So Naomi and Ruth returned to Bethlehem from Moab. Naomi and Ruth arrived in Bethlehem during the season [that people harvest barley]."
RUT,2,1,"Ruth (title) meets Boaz. Naomi had a relative named Boaz. Boaz was in Elimelech's family/clan. People respected Boaz much. Boaz (implicit-info) lived in Bethlehem.  And (implicit-info) Boaz was rich."
RUT,2,2,"One day Ruth [who was from Moab] said to Naomi, [""You(Naomi) (imp) let [me(Ruth) go to the fields]]. I(Ruth) will pick up grain/barley [that people left in the fields]. I(Ruth) will work behind people [that will be kind to me(Ruth)]."" Naomi said to Ruth, [""My(Naomi's) daughter, (imp) go.""]"
RUT,2,3,"So Ruth left. And Ruth entered a field. Ruth started walking behind some people [who were gathering/harvesting grain/barley]. And Ruth picked up the grain/barley [that those people did not gather]. Ruth was working in a field [that belonged to Boaz]. Boaz was in Elimelech's family/clan."
RUT,2,4,"Then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem. Boaz said to the people [that were gathering/harvesting the grain/barley], [""I(Boaz) pray [that Yahweh will be with you(people)]""]! And those people said to Boaz, [""We(people) pray [that Yahweh will do good things for you(Boaz)]""]!"
RUT,2,5,"Then Boaz asked the leader of the workers, [""That young woman belongs to which person?""] ""Who is that woman?"""
RUT,2,6,"That leader answered Boaz, [""That woman is from Moab].  That woman came from Moab to this place with Naomi."
RUT,2,7,"That woman said to me(leader), [""You(leader) (imp) please let [me(Ruth) pick up grain/barley behind the people [that are gathering/harvesting the grain/barley]]""]. So (implicit-info) I(leader) let [that woman gather grain/barley behind the workers/harvesters]. That woman came into this field. And that woman worked from the morning until now.  But that woman rested in the shelter for a few minutes."""
RUT,2,8,"So Boaz (implicit-info) walked to Ruth. Then Boaz said to Ruth, [""My(Boaz's) daughter, you(Ruth) (imp) listen to me(Boaz)]. You(Ruth) (imp) do not go to another field [in order to gather grain/barley]. You(Ruth) (imp) do not leave this field. But you(Ruth) (imp) stay in this field with the women [that work for me(Boaz)]."
RUT,2,9,"You(Ruth) (imp) watch the field [that the men are gathering/harvesting grain/barley in]. And you(Ruth) (imp) follow the women. I(Boaz) told [the men to not touch you(Ruth)]. [Whenever you(Ruth) become thirsty] you(Ruth) (imp) go to those containers. And you(Ruth) (imp) drink the water [that is in those containers]. The men filled those containers with water."""
RUT,2,10,"Then Ruth bowed to Boaz. And Ruth moved Ruth's face to the ground. Then Ruth asked Boaz, [""Why are you(Boaz) kind to me(Ruth)]? I(Ruth) am from another country."""
RUT,2,11,"Boaz answered Ruth, [""People told me(Boaz) about all of the things [that you(Ruth) did for your(Ruth’s) mother-in-law [after your(Ruth’s) husband died]]]. You(Ruth) left your(Ruth’s) father, your(Ruth’s) mother, and the land [that you(Ruth) were born in]. And you(Ruth) came to this land [in order to live with people [that you(Ruth) did not know]]."
RUT,2,12,"I(Boaz) will pray [that Yahweh will do good things for you(Ruth)] [because you(Ruth) did good things]. And I(Boaz) will pray [that Yahweh [who is Israel's God] will do many good things for you(Ruth)]. You(Ruth) came to Yahweh [just like a young bird comes to the bird's mother].  The mother's wings protect that young bird."""
RUT,2,13,"Then Ruth said to Boaz, [""My(Ruth’s) master/lord, I(Ruth) hope [that you(Boaz) will continue treating me(Ruth) very kindly]]. [Although I(Ruth) am not one of your(Boaz’s) servants] you(Boaz) comforted me(Ruth). And you(Boaz) spoke kindly to me(Ruth)."""
RUT,2,14,"[When Boaz and Boaz's workers started eating food] Boaz said to Ruth, [""You(Ruth) (imp) come to this place]. And you(Ruth) (imp) eat some bread. You(Ruth) may dip the bread in this wine/vinegar."" So Ruth sat down beside the workers/harvesters.  Then Boaz gave some grain/barley [that people cooked/roasted] to Ruth. Ruth ate that grain/barley [until Ruth was full]. And Ruth still had more grain/barley [that (implicit-info) Ruth did not eat]."
RUT,2,15,"Then Ruth stood up [in order to start gathering grain/barley again]. Then Boaz commanded the men [that were working for Boaz], [""You(men) (imp) let [Ruth gather grain/barley near the plants/stalks [that you(men) already cut]]]. And you(men) (imp) do not tell/scold [Ruth to stop gathering grain/barley]."
RUT,2,16,"And you(men) pull-out some plants/stalks from the grain/barley [that you(men) cut/harvested].  And you(men) (imp) drop those plants/stalks on the ground [so that Ruth could pick those plants/stalks up]. And you(men) do not tell/scold [Ruth to stop gathering that grain/barley]."
RUT,2,17,"So Ruth picked up grain/barley in that field until the evening. [After Ruth separated the grain/barley from the plants/stalks] Ruth had about 13 kilograms of grain/barley."
RUT,2,18,"Then Ruth carried the grain/barley to the town. And Ruth’s mother-in-law saw the grain/barley [that Ruth gathered]. Ruth also showed Naomi the extra food [that Ruth did not eat earlier]. And Ruth gave that food to Naomi."
RUT,2,19,"Ruth's mother-in-law asked Ruth, [""Where did you(Ruth) gather grain/barley today?] Where did you(Ruth) work? I(Naomi) will pray [that Yahweh will do good things for the man [that helped you(Ruth)]]!""  Then Ruth told Ruth's mother-in-law about the man [that owned the field [that Ruth worked in]]. Ruth said, [""The name of the man [that I(Ruth) worked with today] is Boaz.""]"
RUT,2,20,"Naomi said to Naomi's daughter-in-law, [""I(Naomi) will pray [that Yahweh will do good things for Boaz]]! Yahweh continues to be kind to alive people and dead people.""  Naomi also said to Ruth, [""Boaz is our(Naomi's) close relative].  Boaz is one of our(Naomi's) kinsman-redeemers. Boaz is one of the people [that must protect our(Naomi's) land and our(Naomi's) family]."""
RUT,2,21,"Then Ruth [who was from Moab] said, [""Boaz also said to me(Ruth), [""You(Ruth) (imp) stay with my(Boaz's) workers [until my(Boaz's) workers finish gathering/harvesting all of my(Boaz's) grain/barley]]]."""""
RUT,2,22,"Then Naomi said to Ruth [who was Naomi’s daughter-in-law], [""My(Naomi’s) daughter, you(Ruth) should continue working with the women [who work for Boaz]]. [If you(Ruth) work in another man’s field] people might hurt you(Ruth)."""
RUT,2,23,"So Ruth continued working with the women [that worked for Boaz]. Ruth gathered grain [until the workers finished gathering/harvesting the barley and the wheat].  And Ruth lived with Ruth's mother-in-law."
RUT,3,1,"Ruth (title) meets Boaz at the place [that people separate the grain from the plants at]. One day Ruth's mother-in-law named Naomi said to Ruth, [""My(Naomi's) daughter, I(Naomi) must find a person [that will take care of you(Ruth) well]]."
RUT,3,2,"Recently you(Ruth) were working with the women [that work for Boaz]. Boaz is our(Naomi’s) relative. Tonight Boaz will be separating the grain/barley from the plants at the place [that people separate grain from plants at]."
RUT,3,3,"Therefore you(Ruth) (imp) wash yourself(Ruth). And you(Ruth) (imp) put oil [that smells good] on your(Ruth’s) body. Then you(Ruth) (imp) put on your(Ruth’s) best clothes.  Then you(Ruth) go to the place [that people separate grain from plants at]. But you(Ruth) (imp) do not let [Boaz see you(Ruth)].  Boaz will eat food.  And Boaz will drink wine. You(Ruth) (imp) wait [until Boaz finishes eating food] [and until Boaz finishes drinking wine]."
RUT,3,4,"[When Boaz lies down] you(Ruth) (imp) watch Boaz carefully [so that you(Ruth) could see the place [that Boaz is lying at]]. Later you(Ruth) (imp) go to Boaz. And you(Ruth) (imp) lift the blanket [that is on Boaz's feet].  Then you(Ruth) (imp) lie down.  Boaz (implicit-info) will know [that you(Ruth) want [Boaz to take care of you(Ruth)]].  Then Boaz will tell [you(Ruth) to do certain things]."""
RUT,3,5,"Then Ruth said to Naomi, [""I(Ruth) will do all of the things [that you(Naomi) said]""]."
RUT,3,6,"So Ruth went to the place [that people separate grain/barley from the plants at].  And Ruth did all of the things [that Ruth’s mother-in-law told [Ruth to do]]."
RUT,3,7,"[After (implicit-info) Boaz finished separating the grain/barley from the plants] Boaz ate some food.  And Boaz drank some wine.  Then Boaz was happy. And Boaz lay down beside the pile of grain/barley.  Then (implicit-info) Boaz slept.  Later Ruth came to Boaz quietly.  Ruth lifted the blanket [that was on Boaz’s feet]. Then Ruth lay down."
RUT,3,8,"At about midnight Boaz woke up. And Boaz turned around. Then Boaz saw [a woman lying beside Boaz’s feet]! Boaz (implicit-info) was very surprised."
RUT,3,9,"Boaz asked that woman, [""Who are you(Ruth)?""] Ruth said, [""I(Ruth) am your(Boaz's) servant named Ruth]. You(Boaz) (imp) please cover me(Ruth) with the edge of your(Boaz's) robe [because you(Boaz) are our(Ruth's) family's kinsman-redeemer]."" You(Boaz) (imp) please cover me(Ruth) with the edge of your(Boaz's) robe [because you(Boaz) must protect our(Ruth's) family and our(Ruth's) family's property]."""
RUT,3,10,"Then Boaz said, [""My(Boaz's) daughter, I(Boaz) pray [that Yahweh will do good things for you(Ruth)]]. Previously you(Ruth) were kind.  But now you(Ruth) are being very kind. You(Ruth) did not try [to marry a young man]. You(Ruth) did not look for a rich young man or a poor young man."
RUT,3,11,"My(Boaz’s) daughter, you(Ruth) (imp) do not be afraid. I(Boaz) will do for you(Ruth) all of the things [that you(Ruth) asked [me(Boaz) to do]].  All of the people [that are living in this town] know [that you(Ruth) are a very good woman]."
RUT,3,12,"I(Boaz) am our(Boaz’s) family’s kinsman-redeemer. I(Boaz) must protect our(Boaz’s) family and our(Boaz’s) family’s property. But another man is a closer kinsman-redeemer than me(Boaz). But another man is a closer relative than me(Boaz)."
RUT,3,13,"You(Ruth) (imp) stay at this place tonight. In the morning I(Boaz) will talk to that man. [If that man wants [to be your(Ruth's) kinsman-redeemer]] I(Boaz) must let [that man buy/redeem you(Ruth)]. [If that man wants [to protect your(Ruth's) property and your(Ruth's) family]] I(Boaz) must let [that man buy/redeem you(Ruth)].  But [if that man does not want [to be your(Ruth's) kinsman-redeemer]] I(Boaz) will certainly buy/redeem you(Ruth). But [if that man does not want [to buy/redeem you(Ruth)]] I(Boaz) will certainly buy/redeem you(Ruth). I(Boaz) promise/swear to Yahweh [that I(Boaz) will buy/redeem you(Ruth)].  So you(Ruth) (imp) lie at this place until the morning."""
RUT,3,14,"So Ruth lay near Boaz's feet until the morning. [While the sky was still too dark [so that people could not recognize each-other(people)]] Ruth got up. Then Boaz said, [""People must not know [that a woman came to the place [that people separate grain from plants at]]]."""
RUT,3,15,"Then Boaz also said to Ruth, [""You(Ruth) (imp) bring the coat/shawl [that you(Ruth) are wearing] to me(Boaz)]. And you(Ruth) (imp) hold your(Ruth’s) coat/shawl for me(Boaz). Then Boaz poured six liters of grain/barley on Ruth’s coat/shawl.  Then Boaz put the coat/shawl on Ruth’s back. Then Boaz returned to the town."
RUT,3,16,"Then Ruth came to Ruth’s mother-in-law.  Naomi asked Ruth, [""My(Naomi’s) daughter, which things happened?""] Then Ruth told Naomi about all of things [that Boaz did for Ruth]."
RUT,3,17,"Ruth said, [""Boaz gave these six liters of grain/barley to me(Ruth).] And Boaz said to me(Ruth), [""You(Ruth) (imp) take a gift to your(Ruth's) mother-in-law.""""]"
RUT,3,18,"Then Naomi said, [""My(Naomi’s) daughter, you(Ruth) (imp) wait [until you(Ruth) hear about the things [that Boaz will do]]]. Boaz will certainly talk to that man today."""
RUT,4,1,"(title) Boaz marries Ruth. Boaz went to the town gate. And Boaz sat down near that gate. Then the man/kinsman-redeemer [that Boaz talked about] walked near the gate. So Boaz said to that man, [""My(Boaz’s) friend, you(man) (imp) come to this place]. And you(man) (imp) sit down."" So that man came to Boaz. And that man sat down."
RUT,4,2,"Then Boaz asked [10 old men [that were leaders of that town] to come to that place]. Boaz said to those men, [""You(men) (imp) sit down at this place.""] So those ten old men sat down."
RUT,4,3,"Then Boaz said to the man/kinsman-redeemer, [""Naomi returned from Moab]. Our(Boaz’s) relative named Elimelech owned some land. Now Naomi wants [to sell that land]."
RUT,4,4,"So I(Boaz) thought [that I(Boaz) should tell you(man) about these things]. And I(Boaz) thought [that I(Boaz) should suggest [that you(man) buy that land]]. I(Boaz) am telling you(man) these things in front of the people [that are sitting at this place] and these 10 leaders of our(Boaz's) town. [If you(man) want [to buy/redeem that land]] (imp) you(man) buy/redeem it.  These people (implicit-info) will see/witness [you(man) agreeing [to buy the land]]. But [if you(man) do not want [to buy/redeem that land]] you(man) (imp) tell me(Boaz) [so that I(Boaz) could know].  Only you(man) have the right [in order to buy/redeem that land].  But [if you(man) do not want [to buy/redeem that land]] I(Boaz) have the right [to buy/redeem that land].""  Then that man said, [""I(man) will buy/redeem that land""]."
RUT,4,5,"Then Boaz said, [""On the day [that you(man) buy the land from Naomi on] you(man) must also marry Ruth [who is from Moab]]. Ruth was Elimelech's son's wife.  But Elimelech's son is dead.  You(man) will protect the dead man's name and the dead man's property [by marrying Ruth]. [When you(man) and Ruth have children for Elimelech] (implicit-info) Elimelech's family will continue owning that land."""
RUT,4,6,"The man/kinsman-redeemer said, [""Then I(man) am not able [to buy/redeem that land]]. [If I(man) marry Ruth] [and if Ruth gives birth to a son] my(man’s) sons might receive/inherit less land from me(man). So you(Boaz) (imp) buy/redeem that land for yourself(Boaz). I(man) an not able [to buy/redeem that land""]."
RUT,4,7,"(At that time the people [that lived in Israel] had a custom. [If one person allowed [another person to buy/redeem land]] [or if one person gave/transferred land to another person] that person took off that person’s shoe/sandal. And that person gave that shoe/sandal to the other person. Then other people knew [that the other person owned that land].)"
RUT,4,8,"So the man/kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz, [""You(Boaz) yourself(Boaz) (imp) buy the land.""]  And that man took off that man’s shoe/sandal."
RUT,4,9,"Then Boaz said/announced to the ten old men [that were leaders of that town] and the other people [that were at that place], [""Today you(people) saw/witnessed [me(Boaz) buying from Naomi all of the land [that Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon owned]]]."
RUT,4,10,"I(Boaz) will also marry Ruth [who is from Moab]. Ruth was Mahlon's wife. I(Boaz) will do these things [in order to protect the dead man's name and the dead man's property].

Today you(people) saw/witnessed [me(Boaz) doing these things]!"""
RUT,4,11,"Then those ten old men and all of the people [that were at the gate] said, [""We(people) saw/witnessed [you(Boaz) doing these things]].  We(people) pray [that Yahweh will cause [the woman [that you(Boaz) will marry] to become like Rachel and Leah]]. And we(people) pray [that Yahweh will cause [that woman to give birth to many children] [just like Rachel and Leah gave birth to the children [that became the Israelites]]]. And we(people) pray [that you(Boaz) will become powerful in Ephrathah].  And we(people) pray [that all of the people [who live in Bethlehem] will know about you(Boaz)].

RUT,4,12,"We(people) pray [that Yahweh will give many children to you(Boaz) and this young woman]. And we(people) pray [that your(Boaz’s) family will become like Perez’s family].  Tamar birthed Perez for Judah. (footnote) Tamar was from another country [just like Ruth was from another country]."""
RUT,4,13,"So Boaz married Ruth. [When Boaz sexed Ruth] Yahweh caused [Ruth to become pregnant]. Then Ruth gave birth to a son."
RUT,4,14,"The women [who were living in Bethlehem] said to Naomi, [""We(women) praise Yahweh]. Yahweh gave a kinsman-redeemer to you(Naomi).

RUT,4,15,"This child will cause [you(Naomi) to become happy again [just like you(Naomi) were happy [when you(Naomi) were young]]].

RUT,4,16,"Then Naomi cared for the boy [like Naomi cared for Naomi's sons]."
RUT,4,17,"Naomi's neighbors said, [""Naomi has a son again]!"" The neighbors named the boy Obed. [after Obed grew up] Obed had a son named Jesse. And [after Jesse grew up] Jesse had a son named David. And David became the king."
