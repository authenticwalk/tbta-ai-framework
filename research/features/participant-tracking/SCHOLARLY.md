# Scholarly Research: Participant Tracking

**Feature**: Participant Tracking
**Research Date**: 2025-11-29
**Minimum Sources Required**: 25 scholarly sources
**Focus**: Discourse analysis, information structure, anaphora, reference tracking in cross-linguistic and biblical translation contexts

---

## Executive Summary

Participant tracking is a **universal discourse phenomenon** where speakers manage how they introduce, maintain, and reactivate references to entities across discourse. While all languages track participants, they differ dramatically in whether and how this is grammatically encoded.

### Key Findings:

**Universality**: All languages have participant reference systems (Givón 1983, Lambrecht 1994, Gundel et al. 1993)

**Typological Variation**: Encoding strategies range from:
- **Mandatory grammatical marking**: Japanese/Korean topic markers, Bantu noun class agreement
- **Optional resources**: English articles, Spanish null subjects
- **Pragmatic inference**: Hebrew/Greek (source languages have no dedicated PT morphology)

**Biblical Translation Challenge**: Source languages (Hebrew/Greek) do NOT grammatically encode participant tracking, yet many target languages REQUIRE it. TBTA adds discourse-level analysis to guide translators working into marking languages.

**Theological Stakes**: Moderate to High
- Trinity references interact with participant tracking (Genesis 1:26: presupposed vs. first mention)
- Messianic prophecy: participant identity affects interpretation
- Generic vs. specific reference impacts doctrinal precision

## 1. Foundational Theoretical Frameworks

### 1.1 Givón (1983) - Topic Continuity in Discourse

**Full Citation**: Givón, T. (ed.) (1983). *Topic Continuity in Discourse: A Quantitative Cross-Language Study*. Typological Studies in Language 3. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.

**Key Contributions**:
- Pioneered **quantitative cross-linguistic study** of topic continuity
- Introduced **referential distance** ('look-back') measurement: gap in clauses between previous mention and current mention
- Developed **accessibility hierarchy**: from most continuous/accessible to most discontinuous/inaccessible
- Identified **three discourse measurements**:
  1. **Referential Distance**: Number of clauses since last mention (1 clause = maximally continuous)
  2. **Potential Interference** ('ambiguity'): Other possible referents competing
  3. **Persistence** ('decay'): How long referent remains activated after mention

**Languages Studied**: English (written/spoken), Spanish (spoken), Biblical Hebrew, Amharic, Hausa, Japanese, Chamorro, Ute

**Relevance to TBTA**: Givón's framework provides quantifiable metrics for what TBTA calls "Routine" (low referential distance), "First Mention" (maximum distance), and "Restaging" (high distance after gap).

### 1.2 Lambrecht (1994) - Information Structure and Sentence Form

**Full Citation**: Lambrecht, K. (1994). *Information Structure and Sentence Form: Topic, Focus, and the Mental Representations of Discourse Referents*. Cambridge Studies in Linguistics 71. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

**Key Contributions**:
- Defined **information structure**: How sentence structure reflects speaker's assumptions about hearer's knowledge state
- Identified **four independent categories**:
  1. **Presupposition and Assertion**: What is taken for granted vs. what is claimed
  2. **Identifiability**: Can hearer identify the referent?
  3. **Activation**: Is referent currently in working memory?
  4. **Topic and Focus**: What is the sentence about vs. what is asserted about it

**Cascading Model**:
- Activation and Identification precede Topic establishment
- Once entity is ratified as topic, its activation status becomes irrelevant
- Different from Givón's continuous gradient

**Relevance to TBTA**:
- TBTA "Presupposed" (God in Genesis 1:1) = Lambrecht's "identifiable but not previously mentioned"
- TBTA "Routine" = Lambrecht's "active and topic"
- TBTA "Frame Inferable" = Lambrecht's "inferable" (semantically predictable)

**Full Citation**: Prince, E. F. (1981). Toward a taxonomy of given-new information. In P. Cole (ed.), *Radical Pragmatics*, 223-254. New York: Academic Press.

**Key Contributions**:
- Critiqued simplistic "given-new" binary
- Proposed **Assumed Familiarity** (speaker's assumptions about hearer's knowledge)
- Identified need for:
  1. Taxonomy of linguistic forms
  2. Taxonomy of Assumed Familiarity values
  3. Correlation between forms and familiarity

**Three Dimensions of Givenness Reviewed**:
1. Assumed Familiarity (what Prince prefers)
2. Saliency/Activation
3. Shared Knowledge

**Relevance to TBTA**: Prince's "Assumed Familiarity" directly parallels TBTA's participant tracking values:
- TBTA "First Mention" = New (hearer unfamiliar)
- TBTA "Routine" = Evoked (previously mentioned, hearer familiar)
- TBTA "Presupposed" = Unused/inferable (hearer familiar but not from text)

### 1.4 Gundel, Hedberg, & Zacharski (1993) - Givenness Hierarchy

**Full Citation**: Gundel, J. K., Hedberg, N., & Zacharski, R. (1993). Cognitive Status and the Form of Referring Expressions in Discourse. *Language* 69(2), 274-307.

**Key Contributions**:
- Proposed **Givenness Hierarchy**: Six implicationally related cognitive statuses
  1. **In focus** > 2. **Activated** > 3. **Familiar** > 4. **Uniquely identifiable** > 5. **Referential** > 6. **Type identifiable**
- Each status is **necessary and sufficient** for particular referring expression forms
- Greater attention/memory → phonetically minimal forms (pronouns, zero)
- Lesser attention/memory → phonetically elaborate forms (full NPs)

**Form-Status Mapping** (English examples):
- In focus: *it, that, this, ø* (zero)
- Activated: *this, that, this N*
- Familiar: *that N, this N, definite NP*
- Uniquely identifiable: *the N*
- Referential: *indefinite this N*
- Type identifiable: *a N*

**Relevance to TBTA**:
- TBTA "Routine" = GHZ "In focus" or "Activated"
- TBTA "First Mention" = GHZ "Type identifiable" (indefinite)
- TBTA "Restaging" = GHZ "Familiar" (definite but not activated)
- TBTA "Frame Inferable" = GHZ "Uniquely identifiable" (inferable from context)

**Not a Salience Hierarchy**: Despite common assumption, GH is about *conventional meaning* of forms, not degrees of salience (Gundel et al. 2012).

## 2. Biblical Translation and Discourse Analysis

### 2.1 Levinsohn (2000/2024) - Discourse Features of New Testament Greek

**Full Citation**: Levinsohn, S. H. (2000, rev. 2024). *Discourse Features of New Testament Greek: A Coursebook on the Information Structure of New Testament Greek* (2nd rev. ed.). Dallas: SIL International.

**Key Contributions**:
- Applies functional discourse grammar to Koine Greek New Testament
- **Part III**: Extensive coverage of patterns of reference
  - Why participants sometimes appear only in verb morphology (null subjects)
  - Why participants sometimes require pronoun or full NP
  - Article usage: default rules, reactivation of participants, anarthrous references to activated participants
- **Principle**: "Choice implies meaning" - variation in referring expressions is pragmatically motivated

**Participant Reference Chapters**:
- Chapter 9: The Article with Substantives
  - 9.2.1: Default rules
  - 9.2.2: Reactivation of participants (= TBTA "Restaging")
  - 9.2.3: Anarthrous references to activated participants

**Practical Application**: Complete discourse markup of Greek NT (UBS4/NA27) in BART software, showing proposition-level discourse features for translators.

**Relevance to TBTA**: Levinsohn's work provides Greek-specific discourse analysis that TBTA systematizes. TBTA's "Routine" vs "Restaging" maps to Levinsohn's "activated" vs "reactivation" distinction.

### 2.2 Dooley & Levinsohn (2001) - Analyzing Discourse

**Full Citation**: Dooley, R. A., & Levinsohn, S. H. (2001). *Analyzing Discourse: A Manual of Basic Concepts*. Dallas: SIL International.

**Key Contributions**:
- **Practical methodology** for linguistic field workers analyzing discourse in under-studied languages
- **Chapters 16-18**: Dedicated to participant reference
  - Chapter 16: Basic notions of reference
  - Chapter 17: Sequential (look-back) and VIP (Very Important Participant) strategies
  - Chapter 18: **Eight-step methodology** for analyzing reference patterns

**Three Tasks of Reference Systems** (Dooley & Levinsohn 2001:112):
1. **Semantic**: "Identify the referents unambiguously, distinguishing them from other possible ones" (who did what to whom)
2. **Processing**: "Overcome disruptions in the flow of information"
3. **Discourse-pragmatic**: Mark information structure (topic, focus, prominence)

**Eight-Step Methodology for Analyzing Reference Patterns**:
1. Draw up inventory of reference encoding forms
2. Prepare chart of participant encoding in a text
3. Track the participants
4. Identify context in which each reference occurs
5. Propose default encoding for each context
6. Inspect text for non-default encoding
7. Incorporate modifications to proposals
8. Generalize motivations for deviations from default

**Participants vs. Props**:
- **Participants**: Take active role (do things)
- **Props**: Passive role only (never do significant actions)

**Relevance to TBTA**: This methodology provides systematic procedure for what TBTA annotators must do intuitively. TBTA annotations represent the OUTPUT of this analysis process.

### 2.3 Runge (2010) - Discourse Grammar of the Greek New Testament

**Full Citation**: Runge, S. E. (2010). *Discourse Grammar of the Greek New Testament: A Practical Introduction for Teaching and Exegesis*. Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers.

**Key Contributions**:
- **Cross-linguistic approach**: Examines universal discourse principles before applying to Greek
- **Information structure devices**: Framing, emphasis, left-dislocations, topical framing
- **Participant reference**: Overspecification, right-dislocation, thematic addition, changed reference

**Two Functions Often Conflated as "Emphasis"**:
1. **Topical framing devices**: Give grounding point, connect to what's been introduced
2. **Focal information**: Newly asserted information in marked position

**Participant Reference Strategies**:
- **Overspecification**: Using full NP when pronoun expected (signals topic shift, contrast, or VIP status)
- **Right-dislocation**: NP repeated after clause (thematic highlighting)
- **Thematic address**: Vocatives and direct address forms

**Lexham Discourse Greek New Testament (LDGNT)**: Electronic Greek text annotating all discourse devices described in the grammar.

**Relevance to TBTA**: Runge's "overspecification" = TBTA using full NP for "Routine" participant (marked choice). His "thematic highlighting" = TBTA's VIP or major participant tracking.

**Full Citation**: Van der Merwe, C. H. J. (2019). Participant Tracking in Biblical Hebrew and Obligatory Explicitation of Anaphors in Translation. *Journal for Semitics* 28(2), Article 6746.

**Key Contributions**:
- Compares participant reference **rules in Hebrew** vs **European languages**
- **Problem**: Bible translators reluctant to make anaphors explicit when Hebrew has "only" pronoun
- **Cause**: Pronouns appear "ambiguous" based on European language rules, but are CLEAR in Hebrew based on Hebrew discourse rules
- **Solution**: Translators should **keep participant identifications as clear as in Hebrew via explicitation**

**Hebrew-Specific Patterns**:
- Hebrew uses pronouns where European languages need full NPs
- Hebrew discourse rules make reference clear despite apparent "ambiguity" to European readers
- Target languages often require different encoding to maintain same level of clarity

**Relevance to TBTA**: Validates TBTA's approach of adding discourse analysis not present in Hebrew morphology. Hebrew → English translation requires making implicit participant tracking explicit.

**Full Citation**: Runge, S. L. (2007). *A Discourse-Functional Description of Participant Reference in Biblical Hebrew Narrative*. PhD dissertation, University of Stellenbosch.

**Key Contributions**:
- **Cross-linguistic, discourse-functional description** of participant encoding in Biblical Hebrew narrative
- Test corpus: Exodus 1-12
- **System of reference includes**:
  1. Participant's initial introduction
  2. Continuing reference to participant
  3. Reintroduction after period of absence

**Morphological, Syntactic, and Pragmatic Factors**: Multiple factors impinge on encoding choices - not purely morphological or syntactic, but discourse-pragmatically motivated.

**Relevance to TBTA**: Provides empirical basis for participant tracking in Hebrew narrative. TBTA systematizes these patterns for translation into languages with different reference systems.

## 3. Language-Specific Case Studies

### 3.1 Japanese: Topic Markers (wa/ga) and Zero Anaphora

**Full Citation**: Hinds, J., & Hinds, W. (1979). Participant Identification in Japanese Narrative Discourse. In T. Givón (ed.), *Discourse and Syntax*, 201-226. New York: Academic Press.

(Note: Cited in related research but not directly accessible in search results)

**Related Research**:

**Koiso & Suzuki (2020)**: The WA/GA distinction and switch-reference for ellipted subject identification in Japanese complex sentences. *Journal of East Asian Linguistics*.

**Key Findings**:
- Japanese topic marker **は (wa)** and subject marker **が (ga)** function analogously to switch-reference systems
- **WA signals Same Subject** (continuity): Participant continues from previous clause
- **GA signals Different Subject** (change): New/contrasting participant
- **Over 90% of ellipted subjects** successfully identified solely by WA/GA interaction
- **Zero anaphora**: Extremely common for routine continuation (90%+ in conversation)

**Mismatch with Korean**:
{Portner & Zanuttini 2015}: Japanese **wa** marks "hearer-old" entities (inferable or presupposed, not necessarily mentioned). Korean **nun** marks "episode-old" entities (must be mentioned in current episode). Restaging across episodes uses nominative **ka** in Korean.

**Relevance to TBTA**:
- TBTA "First Mention" → Japanese **が (ga)**
- TBTA "Routine" → Japanese **ø** (zero anaphora)
- TBTA "Presupposed/Frame Inferable" → Japanese **は (wa)**
- TBTA "Restaging" → Japanese **は (wa)** after absence

### 3.2 Korean: Episode-Based Topic Marking

**Full Citation**: Portner, P., & Zanuttini, R. (2015). Mismatch of topic between Japanese and Korean. *Journal of East Asian Linguistics* 24(4), 343-371.

**Key Findings**:
- Korean topic marker **는/은 (neun/eun)** encodes **"episode-old"** entities
- Can ONLY refer back to entity mentioned in **current episode**
- **Across episode boundary**: Old entity re-introduced using nominative marker **가/이 (ka/i)**
- Contrast with Japanese: Japanese **wa** allows presupposed/inferable entities even without prior mention in text

**Episode-Based Logic**:
- **Within-episode continuation** → Topic marker **는/은 (neun/eun)** or zero
- **Cross-episode restaging** → Nominative marker **가/이 (ka/i)** for re-introduction
- **Topic + definiteness**: Topic-marked NPs necessarily have definite (including generic) interpretation

**Relevance to TBTA**:
- TBTA "Routine" (within episode) → Korean topic marker or zero
- TBTA "Restaging" (cross-episode) → Korean nominative marker
- TBTA "First Mention" → Korean nominative marker
- Episode boundaries = natural places for participant status to reset

(Referenced in search results but full text not directly accessible)

**Related Research on Bantu Reference Tracking**:

**Contini-Morava & Ddembe (2018)**: Beyond derivation: Creative use of noun class prefixation for both semantic and reference tracking purposes. *Studies in Language* 42(4), 787-828.

**Key Findings**:
- **Primary function of Bantu noun class system**: Provide "referential clarity" (Van de Velde 2013)
- **Noun class choice** = complex combination: denotative semantics + connotative semantics + **discourse factors (reference tracking, participant disambiguation)**
- **Agreement markers** facilitate identification of pronoun/anaphor referents
- **Class manipulation**: Can signal discourse prominence or shift in perspective

**15-18 Noun Classes** typical in Bantu:
- Each noun assigned to class
- Subject markers on verbs agree with noun class
- Demonstratives, adjectives, pronouns all show class agreement

**Reference Tracking Function**:
- Agreement restricts possible referents: demonstrative in Class 7 can only refer to Class 7 noun
- Multiple participants disambiguated via different noun classes
- **Processing aid**: Agreement markers help identify referent of anaphoric elements

**Relevance to TBTA**:
- Bantu languages grammatically REQUIRE participant disambiguation via noun class
- TBTA annotations help translators know which participant is "in focus" to ensure correct class agreement
- TBTA "Routine" → Use class-agreeing pronoun/subject marker
- TBTA "Restaging" → May require full NP with class prefix for clarity

**Full Citation**: Dryer, M. S., & Haspelmath, M. (eds.). (2013). *The World Atlas of Language Structures Online*. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Available at: https://wals.info/

**Relevant Features**:
- **Feature 37A**: Definite Articles (198 languages have no definite/indefinite article; 45 have indefinite but no definite)
- **Feature 38A**: Indefinite Articles
- **Feature 101A**: Expression of Pronominal Subjects
- **Chapter on Information Structure**: Topic and focus marking strategies

**Key Finding for Participant Tracking**:
{WALS definiteness}: "198 languages have no definite or indefinite article" - yet all languages track given vs. new information via alternative strategies (word order, demonstratives, particles, zero anaphora).

**Implication**: Participant tracking is UNIVERSAL pragmatic need, but grammatical encoding is highly variable. TBTA provides discourse annotations that help translators map to whatever strategy their target language uses.

### 4.2 Grambank: Grammatical Features Database

**Full Citation**: Grambank Consortium. (2023). *Grambank*. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. Available at: https://grambank.clld.org/

**Coverage**: 2,467 languages, 195 grammatical features

**Relevant Features**:
- **Participant marking** (17 features in this domain)
- Strategies to indicate "who does what to whom": Case, verbal indexing, rigid word order
- Switch-reference systems (common in Trans-New Guinea, Australian languages)

**Key Finding**:
{Grambank participant marking}: "Languages that disambiguate roles with case tend to have either verb-final or flexible word order." Participant role marking interacts with word order and verbal indexing.

**Relevance to TBTA**: Grambank shows **400,000+ data points** on how languages grammatically encode participant roles and reference. TBTA annotations must be flexible enough to map to diverse typological strategies.

(Earlier article: Ariel, M. (1988). Referring and accessibility. *Journal of Linguistics* 24, 65-87.)

**Key Contributions**:
- **Accessibility Marking Scale**: Referring expressions correlate with accessibility of referent
  - **High accessibility**: Zero anaphora, unstressed pronouns, agreement markers
  - **Medium accessibility**: Stressed pronouns, demonstratives
  - **Low accessibility**: Full definite NPs, proper names
- **Factors affecting accessibility**:

**Full Citation**: Haiman, J., & Munro, P. (eds.). (1983). *Switch-Reference and Universal Grammar*. Typological Studies in Language 2. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.

**Key Contributions**:
- **Switch-reference definition**: Grammatical system marking whether subject of subordinate clause is same as (SS) or different from (DS) matrix clause subject
- **Clause-chaining constructions**: Switch-reference helps signal relationships between clauses and subjects
- **Participant continuity tracking**: Switch-reference = specialized reference tracking device

**Languages with Switch-Reference**:
- **Trans-New Guinea** family (80+ languages)
- **Australian** languages
- **Native American** languages (Uto-Aztecan, etc.)

**Relevance to TBTA**:
- Switch-reference tracks **subject continuity/change** across clauses
- TBTA Participant Tracking tracks **broader discourse status** (first mention, routine, restaging)
- Complementary but not identical systems
- Languages with switch-reference may need BOTH switch-reference markers AND participant tracking encoding

### 7.1 Kroeger (2017) - Basic Concepts in Information Structure

**Full Citation**: Kroeger, P. R. (2017). Basic Concepts in Information Structure: Topic, Focus, and Givenness. *GIALens* 11(1). Available at: https://www.diu.edu/documents/gialens/Vol11-1/Kroeger-Basic-Concepts-Information-Structure.pdf

**Key Contributions**:
- **All languages mark information status** ("as far as we know, all languages do something to mark information status")
- **Three related but distinct concepts**:
  1. **Topic**: What sentence is about (some languages require topic marking: Russian, Mandarin, Japanese)
  2. **Focus**: New information (all languages mark focus via prosody, word order, or particles)
  3. **Givenness**: Definiteness/familiarity (correlated with topic but not identical)

**Marking Strategies**:
- **Prosody**: English uses intonation for focus
- **Word Order**: Hungarian marks focus via word order
- **Particles**: African languages use focus particles
- **Articles**: Languages with articles use them for definiteness
- **Zero vs. Overt**: Pro-drop languages use null forms for given, overt for new/contrastive

**Definiteness Without Articles**: Finnish has no grammatical definiteness marking but uses topic, focus, and telicity to convey equivalent information.

**Relevance to TBTA**: Information structure is broader than participant tracking. TBTA focuses on **participant-specific** information structure (how to encode participant references), which is subset of general information structure.

## 8. Translation Case Studies

### 8.1 Genesis 4:8 - Participant Tracking and Ambiguity Prevention

**Source**: {TBTA Translation Edge Cases documentation}

**Verse**: "Cain said to Abel his brother. And it came to pass when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him."

**Hebrew**: Subject often implicit in verb morphology

**TBTA Annotation**:
- **Cain**: "Routine" (established participant, continuing as subject)
- **Abel**: "Routine" (established as object)
- **NounListIndex**: Tracks which entity is Cain vs. Abel

**Translation Challenge**:
- Hebrew clear via verb morphology and discourse context
- English/European languages: Pronoun "he killed him" potentially ambiguous without TBTA tracking
- TBTA explicit participant identification prevents translator errors

**Languages Benefiting**:
- Article languages: Know to use definite article for "Routine"
- Topic-prominent languages: Know to use topic marker for continuing participant
- Switch-reference languages: Know to mark subject continuity

### 8.2 Genesis 1:26 - Trinity and Presupposition

**Verse**: "Let us make man in our image"

**TBTA Annotation**:
- **God**: Participant Tracking = "Routine"
- **Number**: Trial (exactly 3)
- **Person**: First Inclusive ("we" including listener)

**Issues**:
1. **Presupposition Problem**: Genesis 1:26 is NOT first mention of God (that's Gen 1:1), but Gen 1:1 marked "Routine" despite being textually first mention
2. **Cultural vs. Textual Givenness**: God is culturally presupposed (readers know who God is), but textually first mention

**Translation Implications**:
- Languages requiring trial number can mark Trinity (exactly 3 persons)
- Topic-prominent languages may use topic marker even at first textual mention (presupposition)
- Article languages may use definite article even at first mention (presupposition)

**Theological Stakes**: Participant tracking interacts with Trinitarian doctrine - "us" must be interpreted as 3 persons (trial), not 2 (dual = heresy) or many (plural = less precise).

## 9. Computational and Corpus Linguistics

### 9.1 Centering Theory (Grosz, Joshi, & Weinstein 1995)

**Full Citation**: Grosz, B. J., Joshi, A. K., & Weinstein, S. (1995). Centering: A framework for modeling the local coherence of discourse. *Computational Linguistics* 21(2), 203-225.

**Key Contributions**:
- **Centering Theory**: Computational model of how discourse entities are ranked and tracked
- **Forward-looking centers (Cf)**: Set of entities mentioned in current utterance, ranked by salience
- **Backward-looking center (Cb)**: Most salient entity from previous utterance
- **Preferred center (Cp)**: Most salient entity in current utterance

**Transitions Between Utterances**:
1. **Continue**: Same Cb, same Cp (most coherent)
2. **Retain**: Same Cb, different Cp
3. **Smooth Shift**: Different Cb, Cb = Cp
4. **Rough Shift**: Different Cb, Cb ≠ Cp (least coherent)

**Relevance to TBTA**:
- TBTA "Routine" = Centering Theory "Continue" (same Cb continuing)
- TBTA "Restaging" = Centering Theory "Rough Shift" (different Cb after gap)
- Centering provides computational formalization of TBTA intuitions

## 10. Summary of Scholarly Consensus

### 10.1 Universal Principles

✅ **All languages have participant reference systems** (Givón 1983, Lambrecht 1994, Dooley & Levinsohn 2001)

✅ **Reference systems accomplish three tasks**: Semantic (identify referents), Processing (overcome disruptions), Discourse-pragmatic (mark information structure) {dooley-levinsohn-2001}

✅ **Referring expression form correlates with accessibility** (Givón 1983, Ariel 1990, Gundel et al. 1993)
- High accessibility → Minimal forms (zero, pronouns)
- Low accessibility → Full forms (NPs, proper names)

✅ **Information structure is universal** but encoding strategies vary (Kroeger 2017, WALS 2013, Grambank 2023)

---

### 10.2 Typological Variation

**Mandatory Grammatical Marking**:
- Japanese/Korean: Topic vs. subject markers required
- Bantu: Noun class agreement required for disambiguation
- Switch-reference languages: SS/DS marking required

**Optional Resources**:
- Article languages (English, Spanish, German): Definite/indefinite articles
- Null-subject languages (Spanish, Italian, Japanese): Zero vs. overt pronoun choice
- Word order: Some languages use position to mark information structure

**Pragmatic Inference Only**:
- Hebrew, Greek (source languages): No dedicated participant tracking morphology
- Participant status inferred from definiteness, word order, context

---

### 10.3 Biblical Translation Specifics

**Source Language Gap**: Hebrew and Greek do NOT grammatically encode participant tracking {van-der-merwe-2019}, yet TBTA adds this layer of analysis. Why?

**Answer**: Target languages often REQUIRE participant tracking marking. TBTA provides discourse analysis to guide translators working into marking languages.

**Validation**: Levinsohn's work {levinsohn-2000} shows Greek uses articles, word order, and pronouns for participant reference - but encoding differs from modern European languages. TBTA systematizes these patterns for cross-linguistic application.
