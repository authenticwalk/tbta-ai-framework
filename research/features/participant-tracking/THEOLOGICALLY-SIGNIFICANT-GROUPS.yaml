# SECTION 1: NON-ARBITRARY (Theologically Critical or Contextually Critical)

non_arbitrary_contexts:

  # 1a. TRINITY REFERENCES (Theologically Critical)
  - verse_pattern: 'Genesis 1:26 - "Let us make man in our image" (unverified)'
    affected_values: [presupposed, routine]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Trinity (nature of God - Three Persons, One Essence)
      - Creation theology
      - Imago Dei (image of God)

    # Why is this non-arbitrary?
    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Participant tracking status affects how "us/our" is interpreted:
      - Marked as PRESUPPOSED: Implies culturally known referent (Trinity)
      - Marked as FIRST MENTION: Implies new revelation of divine plurality
      - TBTA marks as "Routine" but this is theologically problematic (Gen 1:1 is first verse)

      Interaction with Number feature:
      - Trial Number (exactly 3) + Participant Tracking = Explicit Trinity encoding
      - Must avoid Dual (only 2 = Arianism/Binitarianism - HERETICAL)
      - Plural acceptable but less precise than Trial

      Presupposition vs. Textual First Mention:
      - God culturally presupposed (readers know who God is)
      - But textually first mention in Genesis 1:1
      - Participant tracking choice affects article/topic marker use in target languages

    # What is the Orthodox view?
    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: presupposed
      acceptable_alternatives: [first_mention, routine]
      forbidden_values: [] # No PT value itself is forbidden, but must not obscure Trinity
      theological_basis: 'God is eternally existent Trinity: One Essence, Three Persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). Genesis 1:26 reveals divine plurality consistent with Trinity.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - If target language distinguishes presupposed vs. first-textual-mention: Use PRESUPPOSED (God known to readers even before text begins)
        - If target language requires topic marker for established participants: May use topic marker even at Gen 1:1 (presupposition)
        - If target language requires definite article for known entities: Use definite article even at first textual mention
        - Ensure "us/our" clearly refers to God (not angels, not divine council of separate beings)
        - Coordinate with Number feature to ensure Trial (3) or Plural, never Dual (2)

    # What are the alternatives/heresies?
    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Divine Council (God + Angels create together)'
        used_by: [Jewish non-Messianic interpretations, some ancient Near Eastern parallels]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED - Angels do not create (Colossians 1:16 - "all things created by Him and for Him")
      - interpretation: 'Royal Plural (majestic "we")'
        used_by: [Some Jewish medieval commentators, rationalist interpreters]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED - Inconsistent with NT revelation of Trinity, royal plural not elsewhere in Genesis
      - interpretation: 'Polytheism (multiple gods)'
        used_by: [Mormon/LDS theology]
        christian_assessment: HERETICAL - Violates monotheism (Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah 44:6)
      - interpretation: 'Binitarianism (only Father and Son, no Holy Spirit)'
        used_by: [Some early heresies, Arianism variants]
        christian_assessment: HERETICAL - Denies personhood/deity of Holy Spirit

  # 1b. MESSIANIC PROPHECY - Participant Identity (Theologically Critical)
  - verse_pattern: 'Isaiah 53 - The Suffering Servant (unverified)'
    affected_values: [first_mention, routine, restaging]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christology (Jesus as Messiah)
      - Atonement (substitutionary sacrifice)
      - Prophecy fulfillment

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Participant tracking affects identification of "he/him" throughout Isaiah 53:
      - Is "Servant" FIRST MENTION (new participant) or ANAPHORIC to earlier Servant Songs (Isaiah 42, 49, 50)?
      - Christian interpretation: Servant = Jesus Christ (Messianic prophecy)
      - Jewish interpretation: Servant = Israel (corporate identity)

      Participant continuity across chapters:
      - If "Servant" in Isaiah 53 is ROUTINE continuation from Isaiah 52:13, strengthens continuity
      - If RESTAGING after gap, may allow different referent

      Translation impact:
      - Topic-prominent languages: If Servant marked as topic across chapters, signals same referent
      - Article languages: Definite article suggests continuing participant (same Servant)
      - Pronoun vs. full NP: Affects clarity of who suffers

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: routine # Continuous from Isaiah 52:13, same Servant
      acceptable_alternatives: [restaging] # After gap from earlier Servant Songs
      forbidden_values: [generic] # Must not be generic/indefinite servant (loses Messianic specificity)
      theological_basis: 'Jesus Christ is the prophesied Messiah who fulfills the Suffering Servant prophecy (Acts 8:32-35, 1 Peter 2:24-25).'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Maintain participant continuity across Isaiah 52:13-53:12 (same Servant throughout)
        - If target language allows, use forms suggesting definite, specific individual (not generic)
        - Coordinate with denominational traditions: Footnotes may note Jewish interpretation differs
        - Do not obscure connection to NT quotations (Matthew 8:17, John 12:38, Romans 10:16, etc.)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Servant = Nation of Israel (corporate)'
        used_by: [Jewish non-Messianic interpretation, Rashi, Ibn Ezra]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED - NT explicitly identifies Servant as Jesus (Acts 8:32-35); individual suffers, not nation
      - interpretation: 'Servant = Isaiah himself'
        used_by: [Some critical scholars]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED - Isaiah did not die for others' sins; prophecy points beyond author
      - interpretation: 'Servant = Generic righteous sufferer'
        used_by: [Liberal Protestant interpretations]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED - Loses prophetic specificity; NT shows fulfillment in Christ

  # 2. DIVINE VS. HUMAN PARTICIPANTS - Clarity (Contextually Critical)
  - verse_pattern: 'Passages with both God and human participants (e.g., Genesis 18 - Abraham and the three visitors) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [first_mention, routine, frame_inferable]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christophany (pre-incarnate Christ appearances)
      - Angelology (nature and role of angels)
      - Worship (appropriate objects of worship)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Participant tracking affects identification of divine vs. human/angelic participants:
      - Genesis 18: "Three men" visit Abraham, but one is "LORD" (YHWH)
      - Is "LORD" FIRST MENTION or same participant as earlier Genesis mentions of God?
      - Are the "three men" separate participants (angels) or manifestation of Trinity?

      Translation impact:
      - Noun class languages (Bantu): May use different classes for divine vs. human participants
      - Honorific languages (Japanese, Korean): Require different register for divine participants
      - Article languages: Definite article for established divine participant

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: routine # LORD = same God as throughout Genesis (continuity)
      acceptable_alternatives: [presupposed]
      forbidden_values: [first_mention] # God not "new" participant in middle of Genesis
      theological_basis: 'God is eternal and immutable; appearances in OT (theophanies/Christophanies) are same divine person revealed progressively.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Maintain continuity for divine participants across passages
        - If target language marks divine participants with special forms (honorifics, noun classes), apply consistently
        - Do not introduce God as "new" participant mid-narrative
        - Distinguish between God (YHWH) and angels when text does (worship directed only to God)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Three visitors = distinct Trinity manifestation (three separate persons visible)'
        used_by: [Some Orthodox icon traditions, Rublev's Trinity icon]
        christian_assessment: ACCEPTABLE (artistic/theological reflection) but not required by text; Protestant traditions typically see one LORD + two angels
      - interpretation: 'Polytheism (three separate gods)'
        used_by: [Misinterpretations by those unfamiliar with Judeo-Christian monotheism]
        christian_assessment: HERETICAL - Violates monotheism

  # 3. PRONOUN AMBIGUITY IN THEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS (Contextually Critical)
  - verse_pattern: 'John 1:1-3 - "He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through Him" (unverified)'
    affected_values: [routine, restaging]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christology (deity of Christ)
      - Trinity (distinction of Persons)
      - Creation (Christ as Creator)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Participant tracking affects pronoun resolution in theologically dense passages:
      - "He was in the beginning with God" - Who is "He"? (Answer: the Word/Logos = Jesus Christ)
      - Is "He" ROUTINE continuation of "Word" or requires reactivation?
      - Pronoun ambiguity in translation can obscure deity of Christ

      Translation challenges:
      - Languages requiring overt subjects: Must explicitly identify "He" = "the Word"
      - Topic-prominent languages: Topic marker signals continuing referent
      - Zero-anaphora languages: May drop pronoun, requiring clear participant tracking to avoid confusion

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: routine # "He" continues reference to "the Word" from John 1:1
      acceptable_alternatives: [restaging] # If clarity requires reintroducing "the Word" as full NP
      forbidden_values: [generic] # Must be specific referent (Jesus Christ), not generic concept
      theological_basis: 'The Word (Logos) is Jesus Christ, fully God, eternally existent with God the Father, through whom all creation came to be (John 1:14, Colossians 1:16-17, Hebrews 1:2).'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Ensure "He/Him" pronouns clearly refer back to "the Word" (not to "God" = Father)
        - If target language allows ambiguity, use full NP "the Word" or "Jesus Christ" (even if source text has pronoun)
        - Maintain distinction between "Word" (Jesus) and "God" (Father) while affirming both are deity
        - Some languages may need: "The Word was with God, and the Word was God; the Word was in the beginning with God"

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Word = impersonal divine reason/principle (Logos philosophy)'
        used_by: [Arianism, some liberal theology, Jehovah's Witnesses variant]
        christian_assessment: HERETICAL - Word is personal (became flesh, John 1:14), fully divine
      - interpretation: 'Word = created being'
        used_by: [Jehovah's Witnesses, Arianism]
        christian_assessment: HERETICAL - "All things were made through Him" excludes Word from created things; Word is Creator, not creature

  # 4. CORPORATE VS. INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY (Contextually Critical)
  - verse_pattern: 'Paul and Silas narratives (e.g., Acts 16:25 - "they were praying and singing") (unverified)'
    affected_values: [routine, first_mention]
    theological_stakes: LOW-MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - None directly, but affects narrative accuracy

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Participant tracking affects whether pronouns/verbs refer to individuals or groups:
      - "They were praying" - Paul and Silas (2 people) or larger group?
      - Context: Verse 25 clearly "Paul and Silas," but later verses may introduce other participants
      - Wrong participant tracking can confuse readers about who did what

      Translation impact:
      - Dual number languages: Can mark exactly 2 participants
      - Plural: May be ambiguous (2 or more?)
      - Participant tracking helps clarify boundaries

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: routine # When context establishes Paul and Silas as active participants
      acceptable_alternatives: [first_mention] # When new participants join
      forbidden_values: [] # No forbidden values, but accuracy required
      theological_basis: 'Faithful translation requires accurate identification of who performed actions. Misidentifying participants undermines biblical reliability.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Use participant tracking to maintain clear reference to Paul and Silas vs. other participants (jailer, prisoners, household)
        - If target language has dual number, use it for "Paul and Silas" to avoid ambiguity
        - When participant set changes (jailer enters, household converts), update participant tracking appropriately

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: []
    # No significant doctrinal alternatives; this is about narrative accuracy rather than theological interpretation

# SECTION 2: ARBITRARY (Stylistic/Contextual - Translator Freedom)

arbitrary_contexts:

  - pattern: 'Crowd sizes and generic groups (e.g., "multitude," "disciples," "people") (unverified)'
    rationale: |
      Exact participant tracking choice for generic groups does not affect doctrine.
      - "Multitude followed" - whether marked FIRST MENTION or ROUTINE depends on discourse flow, not theology
      - Generic groups often re-introduced with full NP for clarity even when "routine"
      - Translator has freedom to choose based on target language conventions
    estimated_percentage: 40%
    examples:
      - 'Matthew 5:1 - "the crowds" (following Jesus)'
      - 'John 6:2 - "a great crowd" (following for signs)'
      - 'Acts 2:6 - "the multitude" (gathering at Pentecost)'

  - pattern: 'Minor characters who do not affect theological interpretation (unverified)'
    rationale: |
      Many biblical narratives include minor characters whose participant tracking status is stylistic:
      - Servants, messengers, bystanders mentioned briefly
      - Whether introduced with FIRST MENTION or assumed FRAME INFERABLE does not affect doctrine
      - Translator has freedom to follow target language discourse conventions
    estimated_percentage: 25%
    examples:
      - 'Genesis 24 - Servant sent by Abraham (not named)'
      - 'Matthew 26:51 - "one of those with Jesus" (cut off ear)'
      - 'Luke 7:12 - "dead man being carried out" (widow of Nain's son before resurrection)'

  - pattern: 'Inanimate objects and locations (unverified)'
    rationale: |
      Participant tracking for inanimate participants (props) is largely stylistic:
      - "The mountain," "the temple," "the boat"
      - Whether marked FIRST MENTION, ROUTINE, or FRAME INFERABLE does not affect theology
      - Translator follows target language conventions for introducing/tracking objects
    estimated_percentage: 15%
    examples:
      - 'Exodus 3:1 - "the mountain of God" (Horeb/Sinai)'
      - 'Mark 4:1 - "the boat" (Jesus teaching from boat)'
      - 'John 2:14 - "the temple" (cleansing of temple)'

  - pattern: 'Routine narrative participants in non-theological contexts (unverified)'
    rationale: |
      Most everyday narrative participant tracking is stylistic:
      - Travel companions, family members, ordinary interactions
      - How participants are introduced/tracked follows discourse flow, not theological stakes
      - Translator has freedom to choose forms that create natural discourse in target language
    estimated_percentage: 15%
    examples:
      - 'Ruth 1-2 - Naomi, Ruth, Boaz daily interactions'
      - 'Acts 27 - Paul's shipwreck narrative (sailors, soldiers, passengers)'
      - 'Philemon - Onesimus, Philemon, Apphia, Archippus'

  - pattern: 'Generic references to common roles (priests, Pharisees, scribes) (unverified)'
    rationale: |
      Generic participant references ("a scribe," "the Pharisees") are usually stylistic:
      - Unless specific individual has theological significance (Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea)
      - Generic group references can be FIRST MENTION or ROUTINE depending on discourse context
      - Translator chooses based on natural information flow in target language
    estimated_percentage: 5%
    examples:
      - 'Matthew 8:19 - "a scribe" (volunteered to follow Jesus)'
      - 'Mark 2:16 - "the scribes of the Pharisees" (questioned Jesus)'
      - 'Luke 5:17 - "Pharisees and teachers of the law" (sitting there)'

# SUMMARY STATISTICS

total_arbitrary_percentage: 85% # Estimated: sum of arbitrary context percentages (40+25+15+15+5=100% of arbitrary contexts, but arbitrary contexts are 85% of all participant tracking instances)
total_non_arbitrary_percentage: 15% # Estimated: theologically or contextually critical instances requiring careful attention

critical_review_required:
  - All Trinity references (Genesis 1:26, Matthew 28:19, 2 Corinthians 13:14, etc.)
  - All Messianic prophecy participant identifications (Isaiah 53, Psalm 22, Zechariah, etc.)
  - Divine participant introductions and continuity (theophanies, Christophanies)
  - Theologically dense pronoun resolution (John 1, Colossians 1, Hebrews 1)
  - Participant identity affecting atonement/salvation passages

translator_freedom_zones:
  - Generic groups and crowds
  - Minor characters without theological significance
  - Inanimate objects and locations
  - Routine narrative flow
  - Generic role references (unless specific named individual with theological import)

# SPECIAL NOTES

presupposition_issue:
  note: |
    TBTA marks God as "Routine" in Genesis 1:1 despite being textually first mention.
    This conflates CULTURAL PRESUPPOSITION (readers know who God is) with TEXTUAL ANAPHORA (previously mentioned in text).

    Recommendation for translators:
    - Treat God as PRESUPPOSED (known to readers) even at first textual mention
    - Use definite article in article languages ("the God" equivalent) even in Genesis 1:1
    - Use topic marker in topic-prominent languages even at first textual mention
    - Do not treat as FIRST MENTION (indefinite "a god") which could imply polytheism or unknown deity

denominational_sensitivity:
  note: |
    Some participant tracking choices intersect with denominational interpretation differences:
    - Messianic prophecy: Christian vs. Jewish interpretation of Servant identity (Isaiah 53)
    - Divine participants: Trinitarian vs. Unitarian identification
    - Mary references: Catholic/Orthodox emphasis vs. Protestant restraint (not participant tracking issue per se, but interaction with honorifics feature)

    Recommendation:
    - Follow conservative Protestant orthodox position as primary
    - Note denominational variations in footnotes or study notes
    - Avoid obscuring orthodox Christian interpretation
    - Allow for valid Christian denominational differences on non-essentials

interdisciplinary_consultation:
  note: |
    For theologically critical participant tracking decisions, consult:
    - Theological scholars (systematic theology, biblical theology)
    - Exegetical commentators (Hebrew/Greek text experts)
    - Translation consultants (cross-linguistic discourse analysis)
    - Target language speakers (naturalness and clarity)

    Do not make theologically critical participant tracking decisions based solely on linguistic analysis.
