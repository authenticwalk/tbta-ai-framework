# Scholarly Research: Aspect

## Executive Summary

Aspect is one of the most fundamental grammatical categories cross-linguistically, with the perfective/imperfective distinction found in a band across southern Eurasia from Europe to China and extending into Africa. Unlike tense (which locates events in time), aspect describes how an action unfolds - whether viewed as a complete whole (perfective), ongoing process (imperfective), habitual pattern, or specific beginning/completion.

**Key Typological Findings**:
- Perfective/imperfective marking is widespread in Eurasia and Africa, but less common in Southeast Asia and South America {wals-65}
- Source languages (Hebrew, Greek) both explicitly encode aspect morphologically
- Critical for translation into Slavic (Russian, Polish), Niger-Congo (Swahili), Austronesian (Tagalog), and Sino-Tibetan (Mandarin) languages
- Grammatical aspect interacts with lexical aspect (Aktionsart - verb inherent properties)

**Theological Challenges**:
- Greek aorist vs present tense affects interpretation (single event vs repeated action)
- Hebrew perfective/imperfective distinction crucial for prophecy (completed vs ongoing)
- Aspect affects imperatives (one-time command vs habitual instruction)
- Misunderstanding aspect can change theological meaning (habitual sin vs single event)

## 1. Foundational Scholarly Sources

### Comrie, Bernard (1976). *Aspect: An Introduction to the Study of Verbal Aspect and Related Problems*

**Publisher**: Cambridge University Press (reprinted 1978, 1981, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998)

**Key Findings**:
- **Perfective aspect**: Represents a single event as an unanalyzed whole, including its starting point and end point. Denotes a complete situation with beginning, middle, and end {comrie-aspect}
- **Imperfective aspect**: Focuses on the internal temporal structure of a situation, viewing it from within. Encompasses both habitual and continuous/progressive aspects {comrie-aspect}
- **Progressive**: A sub-category of imperfective emphasizing the progressive nature of the verb as an incomplete action in progress {comrie-aspect}
- **Distinction from Aktionsart**: Principled distinction between situation types (actionality/Aktionsart) and grammatically encoded viewpoint aspect (perfective/imperfective) {comrie-aspect}

**Citation Code**: {comrie-1976}

**Relevance**: Foundational typological framework. Comrie's definitions are used by virtually all subsequent aspect research. Critical for understanding the semantic distinction between how an event is viewed (aspect) vs. what kind of event it is (Aktionsart).

**Publication**: Journal article

**Key Findings**:
- Systematic identification of verbal inflection into valence, voice, aspect, tense, mood, and agreement {bybee-dahl-1989}
- Attempted to identify meanings as belonging to traditional categories: perfective, imperfective, past, future {bybee-dahl-1989}
- Grammaticalization paths: Pasts and perfectives may arise from perfects, whereas imperfectives often develop from progressives {bybee-dahl-1989}
- Iteratives and similar constructions can come from various sources {bybee-dahl-1989}

**Citation Code**: {bybee-dahl-1989}

**Relevance**: Demonstrates universal paths of grammaticalization - how aspect systems develop over time. Critical for understanding why certain aspect values cluster together (progressive → imperfective → past).

**Publisher**: University of Chicago Press

**Key Findings**:
- New theory linking grammatical structure and meaning through semantic evolution {bybee-1994}
- Universal set of grammatical categories for tense, aspect, modality identified {bybee-1994}
- Semantic content of categories evolves gradually and similarly across unrelated languages {bybee-1994}

### Vendler, Zeno (1957). "Verbs and Times"

**Publication**: *The Philosophical Review* 66(2): 143-160

**Key Findings**:
- Four categories of lexical aspect (Aktionsart): **States**, **Activities**, **Accomplishments**, **Achievements** {vendler}
- **States vs Achievements**: Achievements are instantaneous; states are durative {vendler}
- **Activities vs Accomplishments**: Both allow continuous/progressive, but accomplishments have terminal point {vendler}
- **Achievements vs Accomplishments**: Achievements are instantaneous (recognize, find); accomplishments are incremental (build house, paint picture) {vendler}

**Examples**:
- States: 'be happy', 'be heavy'
- Activities: 'dance', 'walk in the park'
- Accomplishments: 'build a house', 'walk to the park'
- Achievements: 'find', 'arrive'

**Citation Code**: {vendler-1957}

**Relevance**: Essential for understanding verb classes. TBTA critique identified lack of Aktionsart classification as major weakness. Vendler's system is universally used in linguistics.

**Full Citation**: Vendler, Zeno. 1957. "Verbs and Times." *The Philosophical Review* 66(2): 143-160.

---

### Comrie, Bernard (1976) - Extended Classification with Semelfactives

**Additional Finding**:
- **Semelfactives**: Instantaneous events without change of state: blink, wink, tap, snap, clap, click {vendler}
- Semelfactives are punctual but atelic (no change of state) {vendler}
- Five-way distinction: States, Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements, Semelfactives

**Citation Code**: {comrie-1976-semelfactive}

**Relevance**: Extends Vendler's four-way classification. Important for verbs like "sneeze", "knock" which don't fit Vendler's original categories.

### Grambank Feature GB086: Perfective/Imperfective Aspect on Verbs

**Source**: Grambank database
**URL**: https://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB086

**Feature Definition**: "Is a morphological distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect available on verbs?"

**Values**:
- **1 (present)**: Language has morphological perfective/imperfective distinction
- **0 (absent)**: Language lacks this distinction

**Coding Notes** {grambank-gb086}:
- Coded as 1 even if only one aspect is overtly marked (e.g., imperfective marked, perfective zero or auxiliary)
- Categories may go by different names: punctual/continuous, preterit/progressive, etc.
- Example: Chukchi has progressive vs neutral aspect, with suffix differing by gender (-rkə / -ccə)

**Key Finding** {grambank-gb086}:
- Perfective/imperfective distinction commonly signaled morphologically rather than periphrastically
- Important role in many verb systems

**Citation Code**: {grambank-gb086}

**Relevance**: Provides binary classification for aspect systems. Useful for quickly determining which languages in our translation corpus require aspect marking.

## 3. Language Family Specific Research

### Slavic Languages

#### Dickey, Stephen M. (2000). *Parameters of Slavic Aspect: A Cognitive Approach*

**Key Findings on Slavic Aspect** {slavic-aspect-wiki}:

**Development**:
- Proto-Slavic emphasized aspect over tense relative to Proto-Indo-European {slavic-aspect-wiki}
- Perfective/imperfective distinction robustly attested in earliest Old Church Slavonic texts {slavic-aspect-wiki}
- Proto-Slavic had prefixes which developed into perfective markers before language divergence {slavic-aspect-wiki}
- **Unique to Indo-European**: Slavic is only subfamily using prefixes to mark aspect (others use prefixes for semantic changes) {slavic-aspect-wiki}

**Aspectual Pairs** {slavic-aspect-wiki}:
- Systematic pairings of verbs showing aspectual oppositions
- **Perfective formation**: Usually derived from imperfectives by prefixation
- **Secondary imperfectives**: Derivation by suffixation
- Other processes: Vowel quality, vowel length, stress alternations

**East-West Division** {slavic-aspect-wiki}:
- **Eastern group**: East Slavic languages + Bulgarian
- **Western group**: Czech, Slovak, Sorbian, Slovene
- **Transitional**: Polish (leans east), Serbo-Croatian (leans west)
- Division developed ~17th century through accumulated changes

**Russian Prefixes** {slavic-aspect-wiki}:
- Nearly 2000 perfective verbs formed via "empty prefixes" (čistovidovye pristavki)
- Traditional analysis: Prefixes semantically "empty" when forming aspectual pairs
- Alternative (Janda et al. 2013): Prefixes serve as verb classifiers with semantic content

**Citation Code**: {slavic-aspect}

**Relevance**: Slavic languages are prototypical aspect-prominent languages. Russian Bible translations must choose perfective or imperfective - this directly affects theological interpretation (one-time event vs repeated action).

### Niger-Congo/Bantu Languages

#### Nurse, Derek & Hyman, Larry M. "Tense and Aspect in Niger-Congo"

**Sources**:
- Nurse, Derek. "Data for Tense and Aspect"
- Hyman, Larry M. "Niger-Congo Verb Extensions: Overview and Discussion"

**Key Findings on Niger-Congo Aspect** {niger-congo-aspect}:

**Five Widespread Aspects**:
1. **Factative (FAC) / Perfective (PFV)**
2. **Imperfective (IPFV)**
3. **Perfect (PFT)**
4. **Progressive (PRG)**
5. **Habitual (HAB) / Iterative**

**Tense vs Aspect** {niger-congo-aspect}:
- All Bantu languages encode both aspect and tense
- Majority of Niger-Congo families: Best analyzed as aspect alone (no tense)

**Verbal Extensions** {niger-congo-verbal-extensions}:
- Characteristic feature: (V)(C)V elements suffixed to verb stem
- Can be stacked in complex strings
- **Bantu extensions**: Mostly encode arguments vs aspect
- **Non-Bantu Niger-Congo extensions**: Include aspect (pluractional, completive)

**Aspect-Extension Relationship** {niger-congo-aspect}:
- Plateau and neighboring groups (Nigeria): Syntactic extensions lost, aspect-like extensions remain
- Pluractionality marking widespread in Nigeria and Cameroon
- Uses suffixes resembling Bantu derivational suffixes

**Factative/Imperfective Marking** {niger-congo-aspect}:
- Factative commonly associated with /-i/
- Imperfective commonly associated with /-a/

**Tonal Innovations** {niger-congo-aspect}:
- Derivational extensions deleted when prosodic stem reduced (4 → 3 → 2 syllables)
- Segmental material deleted but associated tones remained
- Floating tones now express aspectual categories

**Citation Code**: {niger-congo-aspect}

**Relevance**: Swahili (Niger-Congo, Bantu) is major Bible translation language. Understanding Niger-Congo aspect systems critical for East African translation context.

### Austronesian Languages

#### Kaufman, Daniel. "Lexical category and alignment in Austronesian"

**Key Findings on Austronesian Aspect**:

**General Features** {austronesian-aspect}:
- Verbal morphology indicates: perfective, imperfective, progressive, prospective aspects
- Extensive use of **outer aspect markers**: 'still' and 'already'
- Reconstructed to Proto-Austronesian: *=daNa ('still'), *=pa ('already')

**Tagalog Aspect System** {austronesian-aspect}:
- Zero allomorph of suffix -in used with aspectual infix ⟨in⟩
- ⟨um⟩ infix has zero allomorph in prospective aspect
- Voice and aspect undergo morphological merger
- Voice marking is prerequisite for aspect marking

**Typological Divisions** {austronesian-aspect}:
1. **Philippine-type**: Philippines, Taiwan, Sabah, North Sulawesi, Madagascar
   - Symmetrical voice system
   - Verb-initial word order
   - Free constituent order (pragmatically determined)
2. **Indonesian-type**: Malay, Indonesian, Javanese
   - Lost symmetrical voice
   - Subject-Verb-Object word order
3. **Post-Indonesian type**

**Proto-Austronesian** {austronesian-aspect}:
- Hypothetically spoken in Taiwan
- Originally used symmetrical voice
- Later dropped in some languages (Malay, Indonesian)

**Citation Code**: {austronesian-aspect}

**Relevance**: Tagalog is major Philippines translation language. Indonesian/Malay are major languages for Indonesia/Malaysia. Understanding aspectual system crucial for Austronesian translation context.

### Sino-Tibetan (Mandarin Chinese)

#### Multiple sources on Chinese aspect markers

**Key Findings on Mandarin Aspect** {chinese-aspect}:

**System Overview**:
- Chinese does NOT use formal tenses {chinese-aspect}
- Uses **grammatical aspect** particles instead
- Context and time expressions convey temporal information

**Three Main Aspect Markers**:

**1. 了 (le) - Perfective** {chinese-aspect}:
- Indicates action completed or situation changed
- Placed after verb (verb suffix)
- Sentence-final 了 (le) = inceptive or perfect aspect (different from verb suffix)
- Focuses on completion or change of state
- Example: 我已经吃了饭 "I have already eaten"

**2. 着 (zhe) - Imperfective/Durative** {chinese-aspect}:
- Indicates ongoing action or state
- Placed immediately after verb
- Emphasizes continuity
- Differs from 在 (zai) in distribution and function
- Example: 她坐着等我 "She is sitting waiting for me"

**3. 过 (guo) - Experiential** {chinese-aspect}:
- Indicates past experience
- Placed directly after verb
- Repeatable past experiences (not one-time events)
- Implies discontinuity (action no longer continuing)
- Example: 我去过中国 "I have been to China (but I'm not there now)"

**Additional Markers** {chinese-aspect}:
- **正在 (zhèngzài) / 在 (zai)**: Precede verb, ongoing actions, "be in process of -ing"
- Used for dynamic events

**Key Distinctions** {chinese-aspect}:
- 了 (le) = change of state, newly completed
- 过 (guo) = experience at least once, no focus on outcome
- For one-time past events: Use 了 (le), NOT 过 (guo)

**Citation Code**: {chinese-aspect}

**Relevance**: Mandarin Chinese is major world language for Bible translation. Understanding Chinese aspect particles critical for translating Greek/Hebrew aspect into Chinese context.

## 4. Biblical Languages Research

### Greek New Testament Aspect

#### Porter, Stanley E. (1989). *Verbal Aspect in the Greek of the New Testament, with Reference to Tense and Mood*

**Publisher**: Peter Lang (New York)

**Key Positions** {greek-aspect}:

**Three Aspects in Greek** {greek-aspect}:
1. **Imperfective aspect**: Present and imperfect tenses - views action internally, in progress
2. **Perfective aspect**: Aorist tense - views action externally, simply or as whole
3. **Stative aspect**: Perfect and pluperfect tenses - indicates state of being

**Tense and Time** {greek-aspect}:
- Porter argues Greek tenses have **no time element**, only aspect
- Time is purely pragmatic (contextual), not semantic
- Controversial position (opposed by Fanning)

**Citation Code**: {porter-1989}

**Relevance**: Major debate in NT Greek studies. If Porter is right, aorist doesn't mean "past", just "perfective". This affects how we translate Greek aspect into languages with/without tense.

---

#### Fanning, Buist M. (1990). *Verbal Aspect in New Testament Greek*

**Publisher**: Clarendon Press (Oxford)

**Key Positions** {greek-aspect}:

**Opposition to Porter**:
- Tense/time IS part of verb semantics in indicative mood {greek-aspect}
- Not purely pragmatic

**Perfect Tense** {greek-aspect}:
- Denotes state resulting from prior occurrence
- Basic sense: Complex state resulting from process

**Areas of Agreement** {greek-aspect}:
- Greek verbs grammatically express aspect
- Aorist = perfective aspect
- Present/Imperfect = imperfective aspect
- No debate on definitions of perfective and imperfective

**Citation Code**: {fanning-1990}

**Relevance**: Provides alternative to Porter. Shows scholarly disagreement on tense vs aspect in Greek. Both agree on perfective/imperfective distinction, disagree on whether time is semantic or pragmatic.

---

#### Campbell, Constantine R. (2007). *Verbal Aspect, the Indicative Mood, and Narrative*

**Key Position** {greek-aspect}:
- Agrees with Porter: Tense/time not part of semantics, purely pragmatic
- Greek is aspect-prominent, not tense-prominent {greek-aspect}
- For two centuries grammars described aspectual Greek using tense-driven frameworks without realizing disconnect {greek-aspect}

**Citation Code**: {campbell-2007}

---

#### The Aorist

**Linguistic Definition** {greek-aspect}:
- Word "aorist" from Ancient Greek ἀόριστος (aóristos 'indefinite')
- Unmarked (default) form of Greek verb
- Does not have implications of imperfective or perfect
- Describes action "pure and simple"
- Often interpreted as strong statement about aspect/time, but actually unmarked form leaves implications to context {greek-aspect}

**Citation Code**: {aorist}

**Relevance**: Understanding aorist as "unmarked" rather than "past perfective" changes translation approach. Explains why TBTA defaults to "Unmarked" - but this loses information aspect-prominent languages need.

---

### Hebrew Old Testament Aspect

#### Cook, John A. (2012). *Time and the Biblical Hebrew Verb: The Expression of Tense, Aspect, and Modality in Biblical Hebrew*

**Key Findings on Hebrew TAM System** {hebrew-aspect}:

**System Overview**:
- Biblical Hebrew = Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM) system {hebrew-aspect}
- Unlike Indo-European focus on tense, Hebrew emphasizes aspect
- Views how action occurs rather than when

**Verb Forms and Aspects**:

**Qatal (Perfect)** {hebrew-aspect}:
- Portrays action as complete, whole, total unit
- Suffix conjugation
- **Perfective aspect**

**Yiqtol (Imperfect)** {hebrew-aspect}:
- Portrays action as incomplete, ongoing, habitual, repeated, not yet realized
- Prefix conjugation
- **Imperfective aspect**
- Sometimes marks future tense (aspect-neutral in some contexts)
- In narrative past contexts: Marks aspect
- With function words: Marks mood

**Wayyiqtol** {hebrew-aspect}:
- Corresponds to qatal (perfective aspect)
- Used for consecutive action sequences
- Normally past tense narrative sequence
- **Debate**: Some scholars say perfective, others say imperfective

**Weqatal and Weyiqtol**:
- Part of imperfective aspect system

**Scholarly Debate** {hebrew-aspect}:
- **View 1**: Hebrew has no tense, only imperfective (yiqtol, wayyiqtol, weyiqtol) and perfective (qatal, weqatal) aspects
- **View 2**: Yiqtol can mark future tense OR aspect OR mood depending on context
- **View 3**: Hebrew verbs don't convey tense; tense deduced from context when translating

**Comparison to Other Semitic** {hebrew-aspect}:
- Ugaritic, Phoenician, Aramaic, Ethiopic, Syriac, Arabic: All have two conjugations (not four)
- Akkadian: Two basic conjugations

**Citation Code**: {hebrew-aspect}

**Relevance**: Hebrew aspectual system is SOURCE LANGUAGE for Old Testament. Understanding qatal/yiqtol distinction critical for translating OT into aspect-prominent languages.

---

#### Waltke, Bruce K. & O'Connor, M. (1990). *An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax*

**Terminology** {hebrew-aspect}:
- Calls qatal forms "suffix conjugation"
- Calls yiqtol forms "prefix conjugation"

**Core System** {hebrew-aspect}:
- Binary opposition: Qatal (perfective) vs yiqtol (non-perfective)
- Wayyiqtol corresponds to qatal as perfective

**Citation Code**: {waltke-oconnor-1990}

## 5. Translation Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Genesis 1:26 - Trinity and Number/Aspect

**Verse**: "Let us make man in our image"

**Hebrew**: נַֽעֲשֶׂ֥ה (na'aseh) - Qal cohortative plural

**Aspect Challenge**:
- Cohortative mood (volitional, "let us")
- Imperfective/incomplete (action proposed, not yet done)
- In languages with aspect marking: Must choose between perfective/imperfective

**Translation Impact**:
- Languages with grammatical aspect must mark whether creation is:
  - **Perfective**: Viewed as complete whole (appropriate - single creative act)
  - **Imperfective**: Viewed as ongoing process (less appropriate - implies process)

**Theological Dimension**:
- Number (plural "us") → Trinity doctrine
- Aspect less theologically critical but affects nuance

**Citation Code**: (unverified - from internal knowledge)

---

### Case Study 2: John 3:16 - Habitual vs Single Event

**Verse**: "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son"

**Greek**:
- ἠγάπησεν (ēgapēsen) - aorist active indicative = perfective aspect
- ἔδωκεν (edōken) - aorist active indicative = perfective aspect

**Aspect Choice**:
- **Aorist (perfective)**: Views as single, complete event
- NOT present (imperfective) which would suggest ongoing, habitual action

**Translation Challenge**:
- In aspect-prominent languages: Must preserve perfective
- Russian: Use perfective form (полюбил, дал)
- Mandarin: Use 了 (le) completion marker
- Swahili: Use completive aspect markers

**Theological Impact**:
- Perfective emphasizes historical act of love (specific giving of Son)
- Imperfective would suggest continuous, habitual love (different theological nuance)
- Both are true theologically, but Greek chose perfective for this verse

**Citation Code**: (unverified - from internal knowledge)

---

### Case Study 3: 1 John 3:6,9 - Habitual Sin

**Verse 6**: "No one who abides in him keeps on sinning"
**Verse 9**: "No one born of God makes a practice of sinning"

**Greek**:
- ἁμαρτάνει (hamartanei) - present active indicative = **imperfective aspect**

**Aspect Critical for Theology**:
- **Present (imperfective)**: Ongoing, habitual, repeated sinning
- NOT aorist (perfective) which would mean single act
- Translation MUST preserve habitual nature or theology changes

**Translation Challenge**:
- English: "keeps on sinning", "makes a practice of"
- Russian: Must use imperfective грешить (greshit') not perfective согрешить (sogreshit')
- Mandarin: Use 着 (zhe) continuative or frequency expressions
- Swahili: Use habitual aspect markers

**Theological Impact**:
- **Correct (imperfective)**: Christians don't habitually, persistently sin
- **Wrong (perfective)**: Christians never sin at all (contradicts 1 John 1:8)
- Aspect distinction is CRITICAL for orthodox theology

**Citation Code**: (unverified - from internal knowledge)

---

### Case Study 4: Matthew 28:19-20 - Imperative Aspect

**Verse**: "Go therefore and make disciples... teaching them... And behold, I am with you always"

**Greek**:
- πορευθέντες (poreuthentes) - aorist participle (perfective)
- μαθητεύσατε (mathēteusate) - aorist imperative (perfective)
- διδάσκοντες (didaskontes) - present participle (imperfective)
- εἰμι (eimi) - present indicative (imperfective/stative)

**Aspect Choices**:
- "Go" (aorist participle): Single decisive action
- "Make disciples" (aorist imperative): Main command, perfective
- "Teaching" (present participle): Ongoing, habitual process
- "I am" (present): Continuous state

**Translation Challenge**:
- Must preserve aspectual distinctions in languages that mark them
- Russian:
  - "Go": Perfective пойти (poiti)
  - "Make disciples": Perfective (single command)
  - "Teaching": Imperfective учить (uchit') - ongoing process
  - "I am": Stative/imperfective

**Theological Impact**:
- Perfective "make disciples" = command to accomplish task
- Imperfective "teaching" = means (ongoing process)
- Aspect affects understanding of mission: One-time command accomplished through ongoing process

**Citation Code**: (unverified - from internal knowledge)

## 6. Critical Insights for Bible Translation

### Insight 1: Source Languages are Aspect-Prominent

**Hebrew** {hebrew-aspect}:
- Binary perfective/imperfective system
- Morphologically encoded (qatal vs yiqtol)
- Aspect more prominent than tense

**Greek** {greek-aspect}:
- Three-way aspectual system (perfective, imperfective, stative)
- Morphologically encoded (aorist, present/imperfect, perfect)
- Scholarly debate whether aspect-prominent or tense-prominent
- Porter/Campbell: Aspect-prominent
- Fanning: Tense also semantic in indicative

**Implication**: Source texts HAVE aspect information. Translation into aspect-prominent target languages can preserve this. Translation into non-aspect languages loses information.

---

### Insight 2: Aktionsart Predicts Aspect

**Problem Identified** {tbta-critique}:
- TBTA lacks Aktionsart (lexical aspect) database
- Results in overgeneralization to "Unmarked"

**Solution from Research**:
- **Vendler Classification** {vendler}: States, Activities, Accomplishments, Achievements
- **Extended** {comrie-1976-semelfactive}: Add Semelfactives
- Aktionsart + Morphology → Semantic Aspect prediction

**Examples**:
- Greek aorist + Accomplishment verb (fill, create) → Completive aspect
- Greek present + State verb (know, be) → Continuous aspect
- Hebrew qatal + Achievement verb (find, arrive) → Perfective aspect

**Implication**: Stage 2-3 must build Aktionsart classifier for Greek/Hebrew verbs.

---

### Insight 3: Aspect-Mood Interactions

**Finding** {tbta-critique}:
- TBTA marks all imperatives as "Indicative" mood
- Suggests aspect-mood interactions not modeled

**Research Insight**:
- Imperatives typically have limited aspect distinctions
- Some languages restrict aspect in subjunctive/jussive moods
- Greek: Imperative can be aorist (perfective) or present (imperfective)
  - Aorist imperative: Single, decisive action
  - Present imperative: Ongoing, repeated action

**Example**:
- Matthew 6:11 "Give us this day our daily bread"
  - δός (dos) - aorist imperative = single request for today
  - NOT present imperative (would be habitual/repeated)

**Implication**: Aspect algorithm must consider mood as gateway feature.

---

### Insight 4: Language Family Specific Needs

**Slavic Languages** {slavic-aspect}:
- **Requirement**: MUST mark perfective vs imperfective on every verb
- **Challenge**: Aspectual pairs (one meaning, two forms)
- **Example**: Russian делать (delat', impf) vs сделать (sdelat', pf) "to do"
- **Translation need**: TBTA must provide aspect guidance or translators guess

**Niger-Congo Languages** {niger-congo-aspect}:
- Five-way aspect system common (Factative, Imperfective, Perfect, Progressive, Habitual)
- Aspect often more important than tense
- Verbal extensions encode aspect
- **Translation need**: Richer aspect distinctions than binary perfective/imperfective

**Austronesian Languages** {austronesian-aspect}:
- Four aspects: Perfective, imperfective, progressive, prospective
- Outer aspect markers: 'still', 'already'
- Voice-aspect morphological merger (Tagalog)
- **Translation need**: Aspect interacts with voice system

**Sino-Tibetan (Mandarin)** {chinese-aspect}:
- No tense, only aspect particles
- Three-way: 了 (le) perfective, 着 (zhe) durative, 过 (guo) experiential
- **Translation need**: Map Greek/Hebrew aspect to Chinese particles

**Implication**: Stage 2 must include diverse language families in translation database.
