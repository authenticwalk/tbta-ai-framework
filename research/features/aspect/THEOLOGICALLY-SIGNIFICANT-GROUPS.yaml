non_arbitrary_contexts:

  # --- THEOLOGICAL (Doctrinal Stakes) ---

  - verse_pattern: '1 John 3:6, 9 - Habitual sin vs single act (unverified)'
    affected_values: [imperfective, perfective]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Sanctification
      - Nature of Christian life
      - Perfectionism vs realistic theology

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Greek uses PRESENT tense (imperfective aspect) for "keeps on sinning" /
      "makes a practice of sinning". This is NOT aorist (perfective = single act).

      CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
      - Imperfective (present): Habitual, ongoing, persistent sinning
      - Perfective (aorist): Single act of sin

      Theological meaning:
      - Correct (imperfective): Christians do not habitually, persistently live in sin
      - WRONG (perfective): Christians never sin at all (contradicts 1 John 1:8)

      Aspect is CRITICAL for orthodox theology. Wrong aspect = heresy (sinless perfectionism).

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: imperfective
      acceptable_alternatives: [progressive, habitual] # Must convey ongoing/repeated nature
      forbidden_values: [perfective, completive, aorist] # NEVER use perfective (changes theology)
      theological_basis: 'Christians do not habitually practice sin, but do commit individual sins (1 John 1:8-10). Imperfective aspect preserves this distinction.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Use IMPERFECTIVE, PROGRESSIVE, or HABITUAL aspect
        - Alternatively: Add "keeps on", "makes a practice of", frequency markers
        - FORBIDDEN: Use perfective/aorist (implies never sin at all)
        - Languages without aspect: Use lexical/adverbial markers for habitual action
        - Test: Does your translation allow for Christians sinning occasionally? (must allow)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Sinless Perfectionism (Christians never sin)'
        used_by: [Wesleyan Perfectionism extreme forms, some Holiness movements]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (Contradicts 1 John 1:8 "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves")
      - interpretation: 'License to sin (aspect distinction irrelevant)'
        used_by: [Antinomianism]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (1 John 3:6 still forbids habitual sin practice)

  - verse_pattern: 'Matthew 28:19-20 - Great Commission imperatives (unverified)'
    affected_values: [perfective, imperfective]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Missiology
      - Nature of discipleship
      - Church mission

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Greek uses AORIST imperative for "make disciples" (μαθητεύσατε) but
      PRESENT participle for "teaching" (διδάσκοντες).

      Aspectual distinction:
      - "Make disciples" (aorist imperative, perfective): Single decisive command to accomplish
      - "Teaching them" (present participle, imperfective): Ongoing process, means of discipleship
      - "I am with you" (present indicative, imperfective): Continuous state

      Theological nuance:
      - Command to make disciples = one-time commission to church (perfective)
      - Means of making disciples = ongoing teaching process (imperfective)
      - Christ's presence = continuous reality (imperfective/stative)

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value:
        - perfective for main command ("make disciples")
        - imperfective for means ("teaching")
      acceptable_alternatives:
        - "make disciples": aorist, perfective, or unmarked imperative
        - "teaching": progressive, habitual, imperfective
      forbidden_values: [] # No forbidden values (lower stakes than habitual sin)
      theological_basis: 'Great Commission is one-time command to church accomplished through ongoing teaching process.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Main command "make disciples": Use decisive/simple imperative (perfective if language has it)
        - Participle "teaching": Use ongoing/progressive form
        - "I am with you": Use continuous/stative present
        - If language lacks aspect: Can use same verb form for both (theological impact minimal)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: [] # No major heresies hinge on this

  - verse_pattern: 'Prophecy fulfillment - Hebrew prophetic perfect (unverified)'
    affected_values: [perfective, imperfective]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Prophecy and fulfillment
      - Certainty of God's promises
      - Eschatology

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Hebrew uses QATAL (perfective) for future events to express certainty:
      "Unto us a child IS BORN" (Isaiah 9:6) - perfect aspect for future event.

      Aspectual meaning:
      - Perfective (qatal): Future viewed as certain/completed (prophetic perfect)
      - Imperfective (yiqtol): Future as uncertain/ongoing

      Theological significance:
      - Perfective emphasizes certainty and divine decree
      - Imperfective would suggest uncertainty or ongoing process

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: perfective
      acceptable_alternatives:
        - perfective
        - perfect
        - simple past (if translating as already completed)
      forbidden_values: [] # Not forbidden, but imperfective loses nuance
      theological_basis: 'Prophetic perfect expresses certainty of future fulfillment as if already accomplished.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Use perfective aspect if available (views future as certain)
        - Alternatively: Translate as past tense ("is born" not "will be born")
        - Or add certainty markers: "certainly will", "surely"
        - Preserves theological emphasis on divine certainty

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: [] # No major issues

  # --- CONTEXTUAL (Affects Clarity/Accuracy but not Doctrine) ---

  - verse_pattern: 'Narrative sequences - Hebrew wayyiqtol chain (unverified)'
    affected_values: [perfective, imperfective]
    theological_stakes: LOW
    affected_doctrines: [] # No doctrinal issues

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Hebrew narrative uses WAYYIQTOL (sequential perfective) for event chains:
      "God created... and God said... and there was..." (Genesis 1)

      Aspectual function:
      - Perfective (wayyiqtol): Sequential completed events
      - Imperfective: Background, description, circumstances

      Contextual importance:
      - Perfective chain = main storyline (foreground)
      - Imperfective = background information, setting
      - Wrong aspect = confuses foreground/background distinction

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: perfective
      acceptable_alternatives: [perfective, simple past, sequential markers]
      forbidden_values: [] # Not forbidden, just less clear
      theological_basis: 'Narrative structure distinction, not doctrinal content.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Use perfective for main event sequence
        - Use imperfective for background/setting
        - If language lacks aspect: Can use same form (minimal theological impact)
        - May add "then", "next" for sequence without aspect

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: [] # Not applicable

  - verse_pattern: 'Imperative commands - one-time vs ongoing (unverified)'
    affected_values: [perfective, imperfective]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christian obedience
      - Interpretation of commands

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Greek distinguishes imperative aspect:
      - AORIST imperative (perfective): Do this once, decisive action
      - PRESENT imperative (imperfective): Keep doing this, ongoing habit

      Examples:
      - "Repent" (aorist): One-time decisive turn from sin
      - "Be holy" (present): Ongoing lifestyle
      - "Give us... bread" (aorist): Single request for today (Lord's Prayer)

      Contextual importance:
      - Wrong aspect changes whether command is one-time or habitual
      - Affects practical obedience understanding

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: match Greek aspect
      acceptable_alternatives:
        - perfective for aorist imperatives
        - imperfective for present imperatives
        - adverbial markers ("once", "always") if aspect unavailable
      forbidden_values: [] # Not forbidden, but changes nuance
      theological_basis: 'Greek imperative aspect affects practical application of command.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Aorist imperative: Use simple/perfective command form
        - Present imperative: Use continuous/habitual form
        - Add frequency markers if language lacks aspect: "keep", "always", "once"
        - Examples:
          - Aorist: "Repent!" (decisive)
          - Present: "Keep praying!" (ongoing)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: [] # Not applicable

  - verse_pattern: 'Greek aorist in parables - single event emphasis (unverified)'
    affected_values: [perfective, imperfective]
    theological_stakes: LOW
    affected_doctrines: [] # Narrative clarity, not doctrine

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Parables often use AORIST (perfective) for key actions:
      - Prodigal son "arose and went" (aorist)
      - Good Samaritan "saw and had compassion" (aorist)

      Aspectual function:
      - Perfective highlights decisive moment
      - Imperfective would emphasize process

      Contextual importance:
      - Parable impact depends on decisive turning point
      - Perfective emphasizes moment of decision

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: perfective
      acceptable_alternatives: [perfective, simple past, unmarked]
      forbidden_values: [] # Not forbidden
      theological_basis: 'Narrative effectiveness, not doctrinal content.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Use perfective/simple past for parable key moments
        - Preserves narrative impact
        - If language lacks aspect: Simple past tense sufficient

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: [] # Not applicable

# SECTION 2: ARBITRARY (Stylistic/Contextual - Theologically Neutral)

arbitrary_contexts:
  - pattern: "General past narrative events"
    rationale: 'Most past events allow either perfective or imperfective without theological change. Example: "Jesus walked to the town" (perfective) vs "Jesus was walking to the town" (imperfective) - both theologically acceptable, stylistic choice.'
    estimated_percentage: 70%

  - pattern: "Descriptive states and conditions"
    rationale: 'Stative verbs and descriptions (e.g., "the sky was blue", "people were hungry") - aspect choice is stylistic unless contrasting with events.'
    estimated_percentage: 10%

  - pattern: "Future predictions (non-prophetic)"
    rationale: 'Non-prophetic future statements (e.g., "it will rain tomorrow") - aspect is stylistic preference unless emphasizing certainty.'
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Questions and dialogue (non-imperative)"
    rationale: 'Questions and statements in dialogue where aspect affects tone but not meaning (e.g., "Did you eat?" vs "Were you eating?") - contextually determined, not theologically critical.'
    estimated_percentage: 10%

  - pattern: "Background information and setting"
    rationale: 'Scene-setting and background information (e.g., "It was evening", "People were gathering") - aspect choice affects narrative style but not theology.'
    estimated_percentage: 5%

# SECTION 3: SUMMARY STATISTICS

estimated_distribution:
  non_arbitrary_theological: 5% # HIGH stakes: Habitual sin, sinless perfectionism
  non_arbitrary_contextual: 15% # MEDIUM stakes: Commands, prophecy, narrative structure
  arbitrary: 80% # Most aspect choices are stylistic

# SECTION 4: TRANSLATOR GUIDANCE SUMMARY

key_principles:
  - "Habitual sin (1 John 3:6,9): MUST use imperfective/habitual aspect or equivalents"
  - "Imperatives: Match Greek aorist (perfective) vs present (imperfective) when possible"
  - "Prophetic perfect: Preserve certainty nuance with perfective or certainty markers"
  - "Narrative: Perfective for foreground, imperfective for background (enhances clarity)"
  - "Most contexts: Aspect choice is stylistic preference, not theologically critical"

high_stakes_verses_requiring_accuracy:
  - "1 John 3:6 - 'No one who abides in him keeps on sinning' (imperfective required)"
  - "1 John 3:9 - 'No one born of God makes a practice of sinning' (imperfective required)"
  - "John 8:11 - 'Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more' (aorist imperative - decisive command)"
  - "Ephesians 4:26 - 'Be angry and do not sin' (present imperative for 'be angry' = can be angry, aorist for 'do not sin' = don't let it lead to sin)"

# SECTION 5: COMMON TRANSLATION ERRORS TO AVOID

common_errors:
  - error: "Using perfective aspect for 1 John 3:6,9"
    impact: "CRITICAL - Changes theology to sinless perfectionism (heresy)"
    correction: "Must use imperfective/habitual aspect"

  - error: "Ignoring imperative aspect distinction in Greek"
    impact: "MEDIUM - Changes whether command is one-time or ongoing"
    correction: "Aorist imperative → perfective/simple; Present imperative → imperfective/ongoing"

  - error: "Using imperfective for prophetic perfect in Hebrew"
    impact: "LOW - Loses emphasis on certainty"
    correction: "Use perfective or certainty markers"

  - error: "Random aspect assignment without considering source language"
    impact: "VARIABLE - May accidentally create theological error"
    correction: "Check Greek/Hebrew aspect; default to matching source language when in doubt"

# NOTES

notes: |
  1. All verse patterns marked (unverified) are based on internal theological/exegetical
     knowledge, not verified from external sources (per STAGE-1-RESEARCH.md guidance allowing
     inference for theological classification).

  2. Aspect theological significance is LOWER than some other features (e.g., number in
     Trinity contexts) but HIGHER for specific contexts (habitual sin, imperatives).

  3. Most dangerous error: Using perfective aspect for habitual sin passages (1 John 3:6,9).
     This is the PRIMARY theologically critical context for aspect.

  4. Stage 2 should analyze actual translations to verify these patterns and discover
     additional non-arbitrary contexts not identified here.

  5. Languages without grammatical aspect can express these distinctions lexically/adverbially
     ("keeps on", "always", "once", etc.).
