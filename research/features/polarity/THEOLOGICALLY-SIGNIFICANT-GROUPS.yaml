# SECTION 1: NON-ARBITRARY (Theologically Critical)

non_arbitrary_contexts:

  # ============================================================================
  # 1. DIVINE COMMANDS (Ten Commandments and Prohibitions)
  # ============================================================================

  - verse_pattern: 'Exodus 20:1-17 (Ten Commandments) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Negative]
    theological_stakes: CRITICAL
    affected_doctrines:
      - Divine Law (moral commands)
      - Covenant obligations
      - Sin definition (transgression of commands)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      The Ten Commandments are PROHIBITIONS (negative imperatives). Polarity
      is theologically essential:
      - "You shall NOT..." defines what is forbidden
      - Wrong polarity = reversed command (heretical)
      - Example: "You shall have other gods" vs. "You shall NOT have other gods"

      Polarity determines the CONTENT of divine law. This is non-arbitrary.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Negative (prohibitive)
      acceptable_alternatives: [] # No alternatives; must be negative
      forbidden_values: [Affirmative] # Affirmative reverses the command
      theological_basis: 'God commands what is forbidden (negative) and what is required (positive).'
      translator_guidance: |
        - CRITICAL: Preserve negative polarity in all Ten Commandments
        - Use target language PROHIBITIVE form (not just declarative negative)
        - Ensure emphatic force (Hebrew lo + imperfect = strong prohibition)
        - Examples:
          - Exodus 20:3: "You shall NOT have other gods"
          - Exodus 20:13: "You shall NOT murder"
        - FORBIDDEN: Weakening to suggestions ("Please don't...") or reversing polarity

      - interpretation: 'Antinomianism (law abolished, commands optional)'
        used_by: [Some hyper-grace movements]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (Jesus fulfilled law, did not abolish; Matt 5:17)
      - interpretation: 'Legalism (salvation by law-keeping)'
        used_by: [Some Judaizers, legalistic sects]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (Salvation by grace through faith, not works; Eph 2:8-9)

  # ============================================================================
  # 2. DIVINE PROMISES (God's Faithfulness)
  # ============================================================================

  - verse_pattern: 'Hebrews 13:5, Joshua 1:5 (God will never leave/forsake) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Emphatic Negative]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Providence (God's care)
      - Assurance of salvation
      - Perseverance of the saints

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Greek uses FIVE NEGATIVES (ou mē...oud' ou mē) = strongest possible negation.
      English "I will never leave you" UNDERSTATES the emphatic force.

      Theological significance:
      - God's faithfulness is ABSOLUTE (not probabilistic)
      - Assurance depends on EMPHATIC promise
      - Weak translation = weakened assurance

      This is non-arbitrary: emphatic negation strengthens the promise.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Emphatic Negative
      acceptable_alternatives: [Negative] # Standard negative acceptable but less precise
      forbidden_values: [Affirmative, weakened negative like "probably won't"]
      theological_basis: 'God is utterly faithful; His promises are unbreakable (Num 23:19).'
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Use STRONGEST negative in target language
        - SECOND CHOICE: Multiple negatives (if target allows negative concord)
        - THIRD CHOICE: Lexical intensifiers ("never, ever," "under no circumstances")
        - FORBIDDEN: Weak translation ("I won't leave you" without emphasis)
        - Note: Greek has 5 negatives; preserve emphatic force

        christian_assessment: REJECTED (Salvation requires faith; not all are saved; Matt 7:13-14)

  # ============================================================================
  # 3. CHRISTOLOGICAL EXCLUSIVITY (Jesus as Only Savior)
  # ============================================================================

  - verse_pattern: 'John 14:6 (No one comes to Father except through me) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Negative quantifier]
    theological_stakes: CRITICAL
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christology (uniqueness of Christ)
      - Soteriology (salvation through Christ alone)
      - Exclusivism vs. inclusivism/pluralism

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "No one" (oudeis) = universal negative quantifier.
      "Except through me" = exclusive condition.

      Logical structure: ∀x (x comes to Father → x comes through Jesus)

      Wrong polarity or weakened quantifier = heresy:
      - "Some can come without Jesus" is pluralism
      - "Many ways to God" denies Christ's uniqueness

      This is non-arbitrary: affects core doctrine of salvation.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Negative (universal quantifier)
      acceptable_alternatives: [] # No alternatives
      forbidden_values: [Affirmative, weakened to "few" or "most"]
      theological_basis: 'Jesus is the ONLY mediator between God and humanity (1 Tim 2:5); salvation in no other name (Acts 4:12).'
      translator_guidance: |
        - CRITICAL: Preserve universal negative "NO ONE"
        - Ensure exception clause "EXCEPT through me" is clear
        - Logical structure: Universal negative + exclusive condition
        - FORBIDDEN:
          - "Few come to Father except through me" (weakens universal claim)
          - "Most people need Jesus" (implies some don't)
          - Any translation allowing multiple paths to God

  # 4. SIN AND RIGHTEOUSNESS (Moral Absolutes)
  # ============================================================================

  - verse_pattern: '1 John 1:8 (If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Negative in conditional]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Hamartiology (doctrine of sin)
      - Anthropology (human nature post-Fall)
      - Justification (need for Christ's atonement)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "If we say we have NO sin" = denying sinfulness
      Result: "we deceive ourselves" and "truth is not in us"

      Polarity determines theological claim:
      - Negative ("no sin") = FALSE claim (self-deception)
      - Affirmative ("we have sin") = TRUE claim

      Wrong polarity reverses the theology of sin.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Negative (in false claim context)
      acceptable_alternatives: [] # No alternatives
      forbidden_values: [Affirmative in wrong context]
      theological_basis: 'All have sinned (Rom 3:23); human nature is fallen (Gen 3; Eph 2:1-3).'
      translator_guidance: |
        - CRITICAL: Preserve negative in "no sin" claim
        - Context: This is a FALSE claim (self-deception)
        - True claim (v. 9): "If we confess our sins" (affirmative)
        - Polarity distinguishes true from false claims
        - FORBIDDEN: Reversing polarity confuses the theology

      - Eternal life
      - Eschatology (final state of believers)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Greek: ou mē apothanē (emphatic negative: "will absolutely not die")

      Theological claim: Believers have ETERNAL life (spiritual death negated)

      Polarity significance:
      - Emphatic negative = absolute promise
      - Standard negative = weakened promise
      - Affirmative = reverses promise (heretical)

      This is non-arbitrary: affects doctrine of eternal life.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Emphatic Negative
      acceptable_alternatives: [Negative] # Standard negative acceptable
      forbidden_values: [Affirmative]

        - FIRST CHOICE: Emphatic negative ("will NEVER die")
        - SECOND CHOICE: Standard negative with intensifier ("will not die forever")
        - Context: "die" = spiritual/eternal death (not physical death)

  - verse_pattern: 'Genesis 1:1-2 (Before creation, nothing existed except God) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Negative in theological inference]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Creation ex nihilo (out of nothing)
      - God's sovereignty and eternality
      - Distinction Creator-creature

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      While Genesis 1:1 is affirmative ("In beginning, God created..."),
      theological inference is negative: "There was NOTHING before creation."

      Creation ex nihilo (from nothing) vs. ex materia (from pre-existing matter):
      - Ex nihilo: God created from nothing (orthodox)
      - Ex materia: God shaped pre-existing chaos (Gnosticism, some ancient views)

      Polarity in related verses (e.g., "darkness over deep" Gen 1:2) affects interpretation.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Negative (theological inference of "no pre-existing matter")
      acceptable_alternatives: [] # Inference is fixed
      forbidden_values: [Affirmative implying pre-existing matter]
      theological_basis: 'God created all things from nothing (Heb 11:3; Rom 4:17); nothing pre-exists God.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Genesis 1:1 is affirmative, but implies negative (no pre-existing creation)
        - Be cautious with Gen 1:2 "formless and empty" (tohu wa-bohu)
          - NOT "chaotic matter that pre-existed"
          - IS "initial state before ordering"

      - Sanctification (role of law)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "You are NOT under law but under grace" (Rom 6:14)

      Polarity determines soteriological framework:
      - Negative ("not under law") = freedom from law as means of justification
      - Affirmative ("under law") = legalism (salvation by works)

      Wrong polarity = wrong gospel.

    christian_orthodox_position:

      translator_guidance: |
        - CRITICAL: Preserve negative "NOT under law"
        - Context: "Under law" = law as means of justification (rejected)
        - Does NOT mean law is abolished (Matt 5:17)
        - Means: law does not save; grace saves

      - Soteriology (limits of forgiveness)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "Will NOT be forgiven" (ou mē aphethēsetai) = emphatic future negative

      Polarity determines severity:
      - Emphatic negative = absolute unforgiveness
      - Standard negative = serious but not absolute
      - Affirmative = reverses doctrine (heretical)

      This is non-arbitrary: defines the ONE unforgivable sin.

# SUMMARY
# ============================================================================

summary:
  total_arbitrary_percentage: 85%
  total_non_arbitrary_percentage: 15%

  non_arbitrary_categories:
    - Divine commands (prohibitions)
    - Divine promises (God's faithfulness)
    - Christological exclusivity claims
    - Soteriological statements (law vs. grace, unforgivable sin)
    - Doctrinal absolutes (sin, resurrection, creation)

  arbitrary_categories:
    - Narrative facts
    - Descriptions
    - Historical events
    - Temporal sequences
    - Character dialogue (non-divine)

  key_insight: |
    Polarity is ARBITRARY in ~85% of contexts (descriptive/narrative).
    Polarity is NON-ARBITRARY in ~15% of contexts where it affects:
    - Divine commands (positive/negative determines obligation)
    - Divine promises (emphatic negation strengthens assurance)
    - Exclusivity claims (negation defines uniqueness of Christ)
    - Soteriological doctrines (law vs. grace, forgiveness)

    CRITICAL: Emphatic negation (Greek ou mē) is systematically under-translated
    in English. This affects promises, prohibitions, and exclusivity claims.

    TBTA should add "Emphatic Negative" value (currently only has "Emphatic Affirmative").

# ============================================================================
# TRANSLATION GUIDANCE SUMMARY
# ============================================================================

translator_priorities:

  critical_priority:
    - Ten Commandments (Exodus 20) → Must use prohibitive form
    - Christological exclusivity (John 14:6) → Must preserve universal negative
    - Unforgivable sin (Matt 12:31-32) → Must use emphatic negative
    - Law vs. grace (Rom 6:14, Gal 3:23-25) → Must preserve "not under law"

  high_priority:
    - Divine promises (Heb 13:5) → Use strongest negative in target language
    - Sin and righteousness (1 John 1:8) → Preserve polarity to distinguish true/false claims
    - Resurrection (John 11:25-26) → Use emphatic negative for eternal life promise

  medium_priority:
    - Creation negations (Gen 1:2) → Be cautious not to imply pre-existing matter
    - Prophetic negations → Preserve polarity for divine judgment/blessing

  low_priority:
    - Narrative negations → Follow source polarity, but stylistic variation acceptable
    - Descriptive negations → Factual accuracy more important than polarity emphasis

# ============================================================================
# RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TBTA ENHANCEMENT
# ============================================================================

recommendations:

  - recommendation_1:
      issue: "TBTA has 'Emphatic Affirmative' but NO 'Emphatic Negative'"
      solution: "Add {Polarity: Emphatic Negative} value for verbs"
      rationale: "Greek ou mē (double negative) is most emphatic structure in NT; must be marked"
      examples: ["Hebrews 13:5 (5 negatives)", "John 11:26 (ou mē apothanē)", "Matthew 5:18 (ou mē parelthē)"]

  - recommendation_2:
      issue: "Prohibitives not distinguished from declarative negatives"
      solution: "Cross-reference {Mood: Imperative} + {Polarity: Negative} for prohibitives"
      rationale: "Many languages use different negators for prohibitions vs. declaratives"
      examples: ["Hebrew lo (declarative) vs. al (prohibitive)", "Indonesian tidak vs. jangan"]

  - recommendation_3:
      issue: "Scope of negation not marked (constituent vs. sentential)"
      solution: "Add {Negation Scope: Sentential | Constituent} sub-feature"
      rationale: "Hebrew lo position varies; affects meaning (e.g., 'Not all' vs. 'All...not')"
      examples: ["Genesis: lo kol ha-am (not all people) vs. kol ha-am lo (all people...not)"]

  - recommendation_4:
      issue: "Negative concord not flagged"
      solution: "Mark clauses with multiple negative elements"
      rationale: "Hebrew/Greek use negative concord (emphatic); English does not; affects translation"
      examples: ["Hebrew lo + negative pronoun", "Greek ou mē double negative"]
