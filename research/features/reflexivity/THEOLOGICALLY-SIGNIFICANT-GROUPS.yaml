non_arbitrary_contexts:

  # GROUP 1: CHRISTOLOGICAL SELF-SACRIFICE (High Stakes)
  - verse_pattern: 'Galatians 2:20, Ephesians 5:25, Titus 2:14, 1 Timothy 2:6 - Christ gave himself (unverified)'
    affected_values: [reflexive]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Atonement (Christ's voluntary self-sacrifice)
      - Christology (divine and human will)
      - Soteriology (means of salvation)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      The reflexive "gave himself" is doctrinally critical. It emphasizes:
      1. VOLUNTARY action - Christ chose to give himself (not was given by another)
      2. SUBSTITUTIONARY - He gave HIMSELF (his own life) as ransom
      3. ACTIVE agency - Not passive victim, active sacrifice

      Failure to mark reflexive could imply:
      - Someone else gave Christ (diminishes voluntary nature)
      - Christ gave something other than himself (weakens substitutionary atonement)
      - Passive rather than active sacrifice (theological error)

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: reflexive
      acceptable_alternatives: []  # No alternatives acceptable
      forbidden_values: [non-reflexive, reciprocal]
      theological_basis: |
        "Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all" (1 Tim 2:6).
        "The Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me" (Gal 2:20).
        Orthodox Christianity affirms Christ's voluntary, substitutionary self-sacrifice.
        The reflexive pronoun ἑαυτόν (heauton) "himself" is explicit in Greek.

      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Mark as reflexive. Use target language's reflexive marker.
        - If target language lacks reflexive pronouns, use alternative construction showing SELF-giving.
        - DO NOT translate as simple "gave" without reflexive - loses critical theological content.
        - Emphasis: Christ is both giver and gift.

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Christ as passive victim only'
        used_by: [Some liberal theology]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (Denies Christ's active agency and voluntary sacrifice)

  # GROUP 2: CHRIST'S SELF-CONSECRATION
  - verse_pattern: 'John 17:19 - I sanctify myself (unverified)'
    affected_values: [reflexive]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christology (Christ's preparation for sacrifice)
      - High priestly work (Christ as both priest and offering)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Christ says "I sanctify myself" (ἁγιάζω ἐμαυτόν hagiazō emauton).
      This is reflexive action showing Christ consecrating HIMSELF for sacrifice.
      Distinguishes Christ's self-consecration from Father sanctifying the Son.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: reflexive
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [non-reflexive, reciprocal]
      theological_basis: |
        High priestly theology - Christ both priest and victim.
        Voluntary self-consecration for the cross.
      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Preserve reflexive construction.
        - Critical distinction: "I sanctify myself" (reflexive) vs "I am sanctified" (passive).

  # GROUP 3: KENOSIS THEOLOGY
  - verse_pattern: 'Philippians 2:7-8 - emptied himself, humbled himself (unverified)'
    affected_values: [reflexive]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Kenosis (Christ's self-emptying)
      - Incarnation theology
      - Divine condescension

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "He emptied himself" (ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσεν heauton ekenōsen) and
      "humbled himself" (ἐταπείνωσεν ἑαυτόν etapeinōsen heauton).

      Reflexive critical to show:
      - ACTIVE self-limitation (not passive diminishment)
      - VOLUNTARY humiliation (not forced)
      - Divine choice to condescend

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: reflexive
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [non-reflexive]
      theological_basis: |
        Kenosis means Christ voluntarily limited himself while remaining fully God.
        Reflexive shows active choice, not loss of divinity.
      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Preserve reflexive to show voluntary action.
        - Avoid passive constructions that imply Christ was emptied/humbled by another.

  # GROUP 4: MUTUAL LOVE COMMANDS (Non-Arbitrary Reciprocal)
  - verse_pattern: 'John 13:34-35, John 15:12,17, Romans 13:8, 1 John 4:7-11 - love one another (unverified)'
    affected_values: [reciprocal]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM-HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christian ethics (defining mark of believers)
      - Community theology (church as mutual love community)
      - Ecclesiology (nature of the church)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "Love one another" (ἀγαπᾶτε ἀλλήλους agapate allēlous) is:
      1. Defining command of Christian community (John 13:34-35)
      2. Evidence of discipleship
      3. RECIPROCAL, not merely collective

      Critical distinction:
      - "Love one another" (reciprocal) = mutual exchange of love
      - "Love yourselves" (reflexive plural) = each person self-love (WRONG interpretation)
      - "Love people" (non-reciprocal) = one-directional love (loses mutuality)

      Reciprocal nature shows church as MUTUAL LOVE community, not hierarchical.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: reciprocal
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [reflexive, non-reciprocal]
      theological_basis: |
        "By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another" (John 13:35).
        Reciprocal love is defining mark of Christian community.
        Greek uses explicit reciprocal pronoun ἀλλήλους (allēlous) "one another."

      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Use reciprocal construction in target language.
        - If target language lacks reciprocal pronouns, use alternative showing MUTUAL action.
        - Avoid reflexive ("love yourselves") which is theologically incorrect.
        - Mutuality is essential to the command.

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: []

  # GROUP 5: MUTUAL SUBMISSION
  - verse_pattern: 'Ephesians 5:21 - submit to one another (unverified)'
    affected_values: [reciprocal]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christian community ethics
      - Household codes (debated interpretation)
      - Authority structures in church

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "Submit to one another" (ὑποτασσόμενοι ἀλλήλοις hypotassomenoi allēlois).

      Uses BOTH:
      1. Middle voice participle (ὑποτασσόμενοι)
      2. Reciprocal pronoun (ἀλλήλοις)

      Theological debate centers on EXTENT of reciprocity:
      - Complete mutual submission (everyone to everyone)?
      - Selective reciprocity within appropriate relationships (context of 5:22ff)?

      BUT: Reciprocal marking itself is not debatable - Greek is explicit.
      Debate is about application, not grammatical construction.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: reciprocal
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [non-reciprocal, reflexive]
      theological_basis: |
        Greek explicitly uses reciprocal pronoun ἀλλήλοις (allēlois).
        Middle voice + reciprocal pronoun = reciprocal middle construction.
        Christian traditions debate APPLICATION but agree on RECIPROCAL nature.

      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Preserve reciprocal construction.
        - Use target language's reciprocal marker.
        - Note: Theological debate is about extent/application, not about reciprocal grammar.
        - Complementarian and egalitarian interpreters BOTH accept reciprocal construction.

  # GROUP 6: MUTUAL FORGIVENESS
  - verse_pattern: 'Colossians 3:13, Ephesians 4:32 - forgive one another (unverified)'
    affected_values: [reciprocal]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christian ethics (forgiveness)
      - Community restoration
      - Ecclesiology (church discipline and reconciliation)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "Forgive one another" (ἀλλήλοις allēlois) - reciprocal command.

      Critical for church community:
      - MUTUAL forgiveness (not unidirectional)
      - Each member both forgiver and forgiven
      - Models God's forgiveness ("as God forgave you")

      Distinguishes from:
      - Reflexive: "forgive yourselves" (self-forgiveness, not the point)
      - Non-reciprocal: "forgive people" (one-directional, loses mutuality)

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: reciprocal
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [reflexive, non-reciprocal]
      theological_basis: |
        Greek explicit reciprocal ἀλλήλους (allēlous).
        Christian community characterized by mutual forgiveness.
      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Use reciprocal construction.
        - Mutuality essential - not unidirectional forgiveness.

  # GROUP 7: MUTUAL ENCOURAGEMENT
  - verse_pattern: '1 Thessalonians 5:11, Hebrews 3:13, 10:25 - encourage/exhort one another (unverified)'
    affected_values: [reciprocal]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christian community life
      - Mutual edification
      - Perseverance of saints (through mutual encouragement)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Reciprocal encouragement commands central to New Testament ecclesiology.
      Church members mutually build up one another - not hierarchical top-down only.

      Reciprocal shows:
      - Every member ministers to others
      - Mutual accountability
      - Body life (1 Cor 12)

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: reciprocal
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [non-reciprocal]
      theological_basis: |
        Priesthood of all believers implies mutual ministry.
        Reciprocal commands show non-hierarchical mutual edification.
      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Preserve reciprocal nature.
        - Avoid hierarchical one-directional interpretation.

  # GROUP 8: TRINITY REFERENCES (Uncertain Application)
  - verse_pattern: 'Genesis 1:26 - Let us make... (unverified, debated)'
    affected_values: [reflexive, reciprocal, non-reflexive]  # Highly debated
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM  # Not primarily reflexivity issue
    affected_doctrines:
      - Trinity (if interpreted as Trinitarian plural)
      - Creation theology

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "Let us make man in our image" - debated interpretation.

      Possible interpretations:
      1. Trinitarian plural (Father, Son, Spirit in mutual counsel) → RECIPROCAL?
      2. Majestic/deliberative plural (common in Hebrew) → NOT reflexive/reciprocal
      3. Divine council (God + angels) → RECIPROCAL (but rejected by orthodoxy)

      PROBLEM: Hebrew doesn't explicitly mark reflexivity/reciprocality here.
      Feature is NOT morphologically marked in Genesis 1:26.
      This is NUMBER system issue (plural "us"), not reflexivity marking.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: non-reflexive  # Neither reflexive nor reciprocal marker needed
      acceptable_alternatives: [reciprocal]  # IF interpreted as Trinitarian mutual counsel
      forbidden_values: []  # No forbidden values for reflexivity per se
      theological_basis: |
        Orthodox Christian: Trinitarian interpretation (Father, Son, Spirit in counsel).
        BUT: Hebrew doesn't mark reflexivity/reciprocality explicitly.
        This is primarily PERSON/NUMBER issue, not reflexivity.

      translator_guidance: |
        - Reflexivity marking NOT the primary issue here.
        - Focus on NUMBER (plural "us") and PERSON system.
        - See Number System feature for detailed guidance.
        - Reciprocal marking only if target language grammatically requires it for plural deliberation.

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Divine Council (God + Angels create together)'
        used_by: [Some Jewish interpretations, Ancient Near Eastern parallels]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (Angels do not create; contradicts "God created" singular in Gen 1:27)
      - interpretation: 'Polytheism (multiple gods)'
        used_by: [Mormon/LDS theology]
        christian_assessment: HERETICAL (Violates monotheism, Shema)

# SECTION 2: ARBITRARY (Stylistic/Contextual)

arbitrary_contexts:

  - pattern: "Grooming and body care actions (wash oneself, dress oneself, etc.)"
    rationale: |
      Naturally reflexive events - stylistic choice whether to mark explicitly.
      Greek uses middle voice; some languages require reflexive pronouns; others zero-mark.
      No theological content affected by choice of marking strategy.
    estimated_percentage: 35%

  - pattern: "Mental processes (think to oneself, say to oneself, consider)"
    rationale: |
      Internal reflexive actions - marking optional in many languages.
      Theological content in WHAT is thought/said, not in reflexive marking.
    estimated_percentage: 20%

  - pattern: "Movement and position (stand up, sit down, turn around)"
    rationale: |
      May be marked as middle/reflexive in some languages, zero in others.
      Translation choice based on target language requirements, not theology.
    estimated_percentage: 15%

  - pattern: "Reciprocal social interactions (greet one another, meet with each other) - non-theological"
    rationale: |
      Reciprocal marking required by some languages, optional in others.
      When NOT part of doctrinal command, marking is stylistic.
      Example: "They greeted one another" in narrative - contextual detail, not doctrine.
    estimated_percentage: 10%

  - pattern: "Deponent verbs (Greek middle voice with active meaning)"
    rationale: |
      Morphologically middle but semantically NOT reflexive.
      Example: ἔρχομαι (erchomai) "I come" - middle form, active meaning.
      Should mark as NON-REFLEXIVE despite morphology.
      Semantic function determines TBTA marking, not form.
    estimated_percentage: 15%

  - pattern: "Collective motion (gather together, assemble)"
    rationale: |
      May be reciprocal OR simply collective (group action without mutual interaction).
      Context determines, but rarely theologically significant which interpretation.
      Example: "They gathered together" - collective or reciprocal, theologically neutral.
    estimated_percentage: 5%

# SECTION 3: ANNOTATION GUIDELINES

annotation_priorities:
  high_priority_marking:
    - "All Christological self-sacrifice passages (gave himself, etc.)"
    - "All mutual love/submission/forgiveness commands using reciprocal pronouns"
    - "Explicit reflexive pronouns (ἑαυτόν heauton, etc.) in theologically loaded contexts"

  medium_priority_marking:
    - "Middle voice verbs in contexts where reflexive interpretation affects meaning"
    - "Reciprocal constructions in ethical/ecclesiological commands"

  low_priority_marking:
    - "Naturally reflexive body care/grooming actions"
    - "Deponent verbs (mark as non-reflexive)"
    - "Stylistic middle voice uses"

special_cases:
  deponent_verbs:
    policy: "Mark as NON-REFLEXIVE (N) even though morphologically middle"
    rationale: "Semantic function determines TBTA value, not morphological form"
    examples: "γίνομαι (become), ἔρχομαι (come), πορεύομαι (go)"

  hebrew_hitpael:
    policy: "Context determines whether reflexive or reciprocal or iterative"
    rationale: "Single Hitpael form can have multiple functions"
    requires: "Contextual analysis, not automatic marking"

  hebrew_niphal:
    policy: "Mark as reflexive only when semantically clear from context"
    rationale: "Niphal is primarily middle voice, secondarily reflexive/passive"
    ambiguity: "Often cannot distinguish reflexive from passive without context"

  implicit_reciprocals:
    policy: "Mark as reciprocal if context clearly implies mutual action, even without explicit reciprocal pronoun"
    example: "Matthew 16:7 - 'They discussed' (plural middle voice, context implies 'among themselves')"
    caution: "Use conservatively - require strong contextual evidence"

# SECTION 4: CROSS-FEATURE INTERACTIONS

related_features:
  voice:
    interaction: "Greek middle voice often encodes reflexivity/reciprocality"
    note: "Not all middle = reflexive (deponents!)"

  number:
    interaction: "Plural subjects enable reciprocal interpretation of middle voice"
    note: "Singular middle = reflexive OR middle, never reciprocal"

  person:
    interaction: "1st/2nd person reciprocals imply inclusion in group"
    example: "'We love one another' = inclusive group action"

researcher_notes: |
  This classification prioritizes Christological self-sacrifice and mutual love commands as non-arbitrary.
  Most reflexive/reciprocal marking is stylistic/contextual (arbitrary).
  Key challenge: Deponent verbs must be distinguished from true reflexives.
  Hebrew stems (Hitpael/Niphal) require contextual analysis beyond morphology.
