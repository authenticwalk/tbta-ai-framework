# Scholarly Research: Reflexivity

## Executive Summary

Reflexivity is a well-studied grammatical category in linguistic typology that marks whether an action affects the subject itself (reflexive) or involves mutual action between participants (reciprocal). Cross-linguistic research reveals significant typological variation: some languages conflate reflexive and reciprocal marking (common in European languages), while others maintain strict distinctions (e.g., Hindi). Greek middle voice and Hebrew Hitpael/Niphal stems provide explicit morphological encoding in source languages, though ambiguities exist (deponent verbs in Greek, context-dependent interpretation in Hebrew). Theological challenges arise in passages involving self-sacrifice (Christ "gave himself"), mutual love commands ("love one another"), and Trinity-related reflexivity, where translation choices can affect doctrinal clarity.

**Key typological findings**:
- **WALS Feature 47A**: 56% of surveyed languages show some reflexive-intensifier identity
- **WALS Feature 106A**: Reflexive-reciprocal polysemy common but not universal
- **Source languages**: Both Greek and Hebrew mark reflexivity morphologically
- **Encoding strategies**: Pronouns, verbal affixes/clitics, stem derivation, zero-marking

**Theological stakes**: Non-arbitrary in contexts of Christological self-giving, reciprocal love commands, and passages where reflexive vs. reciprocal distinction affects meaning.

### Haspelmath, Martin et al. (eds.) (2023). *Reflexive Constructions in the World's Languages*

**Publication**: Language Science Press, Berlin. 867 pages.

**Key Findings**:
- Provides comprehensive cross-linguistic overview of reflexive construction types
- Distinguishes reflexive pronouns from reflexive voice markers
- Identifies empirically observable universals concerning reflexive marking
- Argues universals have basis in frequency asymmetry: object-subject coreference is much less frequent than disjoint reference

**Citation Code**: {haspelmath-2023-reflexives}

**Relevance**: Foundational typological framework for understanding reflexive category cross-linguistically. Helps identify which features of reflexivity are universal vs. language-specific.

### Haspelmath, Martin (2008). "A Frequentist Explanation of Some Universals of Reflexive Marking"

**Key Findings**:
- **Reflexive pronouns are generally longer than anaphoric pronouns** (e.g., English "himself" vs. "him")
- This length asymmetry links to frequency: coreference between object and subject is much rarer than disjoint reference
- Form-frequency correspondence principle: more frequent forms are shorter
- Inverse relationship: reflexives are less frequent → longer forms

**Citation Code**: {haspelmath-2008-frequentist}

**Relevance**: Explains why languages develop special reflexive markers and predicts their formal properties. Informs expectations about target language reflexive marking patterns.

### Kemmer, Suzanne (1993). *The Middle Voice*

**Publication**: John Benjamins Publishing Co. Typological Studies in Language, Volume 23.

**Key Findings**:
- **First systematic cross-linguistic study of middle voice**
- Based on 32-language sample
- Middle voice constitutes **"coherent but relatively diffused category"** with loosely linked semantic subdomains
- Middle markers occur on well-defined situation types:
  - Valency-related: reflexive, passive, reciprocal
  - Motion verbs (body motion, collective motion)
  - Experiencer verbs (perception, mental activity, cognition)
  - Speech acts
- **Relative elaboration of events**: Middle situations intermediate in transitivity between one-participant and two-participant events
- Reflexive and middle differentiated: reflexives more transitive/elaborated than middles

**Citation Code**: {kemmer-1993-middle}

**Relevance**: Critical for understanding how reflexive constructions relate to middle voice systems. Greek middle voice must be understood in Kemmer's framework. Identifies semantic classes of naturally reflexive/middle events (grooming, body care, position change).

### Allan, Rutger J. (2003). *The Middle Voice in Ancient Greek: A Study in Polysemy*

**Publication**: Amsterdam Studies in Classical Philology, Volume 11. Brill.

**Key Findings**:
- Greek middle voice is **polysemous category** (multiple related meanings)
- **Eleven Classical Greek middle voice types**:
  1. Passive middle
  2. Spontaneous process middle
  3. Mental process middle
  4. Body motion middle
  5. Collective motion middle
  6. Reciprocal middle
  7. Direct reflexive middle
  8. Perception middle
  9. Mental activity middle
  10. Speech act middle
  11. Indirect reflexive middle
- **Critical argument**: Greek middle voice NOT derived from reflexive (unlike some languages)
- Middle voice in Greek represents "undifferentiated middle" where subject concerned with itself but not as differentiated object

**Citation Code**: {allan-2003-greek-middle}

**Relevance**: Essential for understanding Greek source text. Distinguishes true reflexives from deponent verbs and other middle functions. Provides framework for TBTA annotation of Greek middle voice forms - not all middles are semantically reflexive.

**Source**: https://brill.com/display/title/13602

**Related**: Referenced by New Testament scholars for understanding Koine Greek middle voice in biblical texts.

### Geniušienė, Emma (1987). *The Typology of Reflexives*

**Publication**: English translation of *Refleksyvų tipologija*. Influential St. Petersburg school typological work.

**Key Findings**:
- Foundational typological work on reflexive voice systems
- Taxonomy of valency changes in reflexive verbs
- Categories include:
  - Autocausative reflexives (subject causes itself to do something)
  - Decausative reflexives (removed causation)
  - Reflexive passives
- Semantic typology of reflexive verb types across languages
- Comparative analysis: Russian, German, Lithuanian, Latvian

**Citation Code**: {genusiene-1987-reflexives}

**Relevance**: Early typological framework cited by Kemmer (1993) and Haspelmath. Establishes baseline for cross-linguistic reflexive classification. Particularly relevant for Slavic reflexive markers (Russian -ся similar to Belarusian, which is in our dataset).

**Publication**: In Frajzyngier & Curl (eds.) *Reflexives: Forms and Functions*. Amsterdam: Benjamins. pp. 41-74.

**Key Findings**:
- Historical development: reflexive anaphors often derive from **intensifier + personal pronoun**
  - English: "He saw him self" → "He saw himself"
- Cross-linguistic pattern: intensifiers grammaticalize into reflexive pronouns
- **Identity vs. differentiation correlates with other properties**:
  - If language uses same expression for intensifier AND reflexive → NOT used as middle marker
  - If differentiated → reflexive can be used for middle/derived intransitivity
- Reflexive pronouns typically **longer than regular pronouns** (correlates with Haspelmath's frequency finding)
- Body part origins common: 24 languages derive reflexives from body part terms
  - Basque: *buru-* "head"
  - Ngiti: *ndɨ̀* "skin"

**Citation Code**: {konig-siemund-2000-intensifiers}

**Relevance**: Explains diachronic sources of reflexive pronouns. Predicts formal properties of reflexive markers in target languages. Important for understanding why some languages conflate intensifiers with reflexives.

### König, Ekkehard, Peter Siemund, & Stephan Töpper. "Intensifiers and Reflexive Pronouns" (WALS Chapter 47A)

**Publication**: World Atlas of Language Structures Online. https://wals.info/chapter/47

**Key Findings** (from 168-language sample):
- **61 languages (36%)**: Complete identity of reflexive and intensifier
- **33 languages (20%)**: Partial identity
- **74 languages (44%)**: Clear formal distinction
- **Combined**: 56% show some reflexive-intensifier identity
- Long-distance binding: Reflexives allowing long-distance binding (Norwegian *seg*, Latin *se*) invariably different from intensifiers
- Local binding: English-type reflexives (local binding only) can be identical to intensifiers

**Citation Code**: {wals-47a}

**Relevance**: Quantifies cross-linguistic variation in reflexive encoding. Provides baseline expectations for target language survey. Identifies areal/genetic patterns.

### Maslova, Elena & Vladimir P. Nedjalkov. "Reciprocal Constructions" (WALS Chapter 106A)

**Publication**: World Atlas of Language Structures Online. https://wals.info/chapter/106

**Key Findings**:
- Reciprocal situations: "They love each other" - comprises at least two simple situations
- **Iconic encoding**: Combine expressions for two simple situations (possible in all languages)
- **Non-iconic encoding**: Simple/complex reciprocal markers (verbal affixes, pronouns, particles)
- **Critical typological parameter**: Can reciprocal markers also express reflexive meaning?
  - **Reflexive-reciprocal polysemy**: Common in "Standard Average European" languages
  - **Distinct markers**: Hindi has only non-reflexive reciprocal (separate from reflexive)
- Reciprocal and reflexive "share essential feature: each participant plays two distinct roles in the same situation"
- Yet they are "clearly different" semantically

**Citation Code**: {wals-106a}

**Relevance**: Establishes that reflexive-reciprocal polysemy is NOT universal. Critical for target language selection - need to include languages that distinguish vs. conflate these categories. Affects TBTA annotation policy: should we expect distinct values or allow conflation?

**Source**: https://wals.info/chapter/106

### Wallace, Daniel B. (1996). *Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of the New Testament*

**Key Findings on Middle Voice**:
- Middle voice in Koine Greek has multiple functions beyond simple reflexive
- **Deponent verbs**: Middle/passive forms with active meaning
  - Example: γίνομαι (*ginomai*) "I become" - middle form, active meaning
  - Wallace: true deponents "lost or never had active form"
  - Not semantically reflexive despite morphological middle
- **Direct middle**: Subject acts on itself directly
- **Indirect middle**: Subject acts for own benefit (self-benefactive)
- **Debate**: Some scholars (e.g., Rutger Allan) argue all "deponents" actually have middle meaning, just glossed with English actives

**Citation Code**: {wallace-1996-beyond-basics}

**Relevance**: Standard NT Greek reference grammar. Critical for determining which Greek middle voice forms should be marked as reflexive in TBTA vs. marked as non-applicable (deponents). Provides framework for exegetical decisions.

**Source**: Referenced in https://bible.org/seriespage/appendix-9-middle-voice-1-corinthians-138

**Example application**: 1 Cor 13:8 παύσονται (*pausontai*) "will cease" (middle voice) - Wallace: "tongues will cease of their own accord" (indirect middle), not reflexive

## 2. Hebrew Source Language: Niphal and Hitpael Stems

### unfoldingWord® Hebrew Grammar (UHG). "Stem Hithpael"

**Source**: https://uhg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stem_hithpael.html

**Key Findings**:
- Hitpael (הִתְפַּעֵל) = primary reflexive stem in Biblical Hebrew
- **Morphology**:
  - Prefix הִתְ (*hit-*)
  - Dagesh forte in second root letter
  - Derived from Piel (intensive) stem
- **Multiple functions**:
  1. **Reflexive**: Subject acts on itself (קדש → הִתְקַדֵּשׁ *hitqaddēš* "sanctify oneself")
  2. **Reciprocal**: Mutual action between participants
  3. **Iterative**: Repeated action (הלך → הִתְהַלֵּךְ *hithallēk* "walk about repeatedly")
  4. **Middle voice**: Action affecting subject indirectly
  5. **Passive** (in some cases)
- **Critical ambiguity**: Single Hitpael form can be reflexive OR reciprocal OR iterative
- Context determines which function

**Citation Code**: {uhg-hithpael}

**Relevance**: Foundational for TBTA Hebrew annotation. Hitpael stem provides morphological evidence but semantic function requires contextual analysis. Cannot assume all Hitpael = reflexive.

---

### Biblical Hebrew Resources. "Hitpael: The Reflexive and Iterative Force of the Hitpael Stem"

**Source**: https://biblicalhebrew.org/hitpael-the-reflexive-and-iterative-force-of-the-hitpael-stem.aspx

**Key Examples**:
- 1 Samuel 30:6: וַיִּתְחַזֵּק (*vayitchazeq*) "he strengthened himself" - clear reflexive
- Ritual contexts: הִתְקַדֵּשׁ (*hitqaddēš*) "sanctify oneself"
- Confession: הִתְוַדָּה (*hitvaddāh*) "confess" (middle/reflexive)
- Self-exaltation: הִתְהַלֵּל (*hithallēl*) "boast" (reflexive component)

**Citation Code**: {biblicalhebrew-hitpael}

**Relevance**: Provides biblical examples of reflexive Hitpael usage. Shows semantic range and contextual variation.

---

### unfoldingWord® Hebrew Grammar (UHG). "Stem Niphal"

**Source**: https://uhg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stem_niphal.html

**Key Findings**:
- Niphal = **secondary reflexive** stem (also passive, middle)
- **Morphology**: Prefix נ (*n-*) with various vowel patterns
- **Historical understanding** (older grammarians): Simply passive of Qal - INCORRECT
- **Modern understanding**: Primarily reflexive/middle, with secondary passive function
- **Six middle voice types** in Niphal:
  1. Body action middles
  2. Mental middles
  3. Reciprocal middles
  4. Collective motion middles
  5. Anti-causative middles
  6. Medio-passive middles
- Examples:
  - נִשְׁמַר (*nišmar*) "guard oneself" (reflexive) vs. "be guarded" (passive)
  - Context determines interpretation

**Citation Code**: {uhg-niphal}

**Relevance**: Niphal more ambiguous than Hitpael for reflexivity marking. Policy needed: mark all Niphal as potentially reflexive, or only when context is clear? Demonstrates source language encoding challenges.

---

### van Wolde, Ellen (2017). "The Niphal as middle voice and its consequence for meaning"

**Source**: *Journal for Semitics* 26(2). https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309089217743160

**Key Findings**:
- **Thesis**: Niphal expresses middle voice, not primarily passive or reflexive
- Following Jenni's extensive study: Niphal does NOT express reflexive voice
- **Middle voice definition**: Subject concerned with itself as "undifferentiated middle," not as differentiated object (true reflexive)
- Niphal prefix -n- acts as **middle marker**
- Semantic distinction between passive and middle "can only be derived from context"
- Six middle voice types identified (listed above under UHG Niphal)

**Citation Code**: {vanwolde-2017-niphal-middle}

**Relevance**: Challenges simple reflexive interpretation of Niphal. Aligns with Kemmer (1993) and Allan (2003) middle voice frameworks. Suggests TBTA should mark Niphal based on semantic function (context-dependent), not morphology alone.

## 3. Translation Case Studies

### Case Study 1: John 13:34 - "Love One Another" (Reciprocal)

**Greek text**: ἀγαπᾶτε ἀλλήλους (*agapate allēlous*)

**Analysis**:
- **ἀγαπᾶτε** (*agapate*): Present active subjunctive, 2nd person plural, "you love"
- **ἀλλήλους** (*allēlous*): Reciprocal pronoun, accusative plural, "one another"
- **Construction**: Active verb + explicit reciprocal pronoun (not middle voice)

**Translation implications**:
- Languages with dedicated reciprocal markers: Use reciprocal marker
- Languages without reciprocal pronouns: Must use alternative strategies
  - Distributive construction: "Each of you love the others"
  - Plural context: "Love yourselves" (with plural marking)
  - Verbal reciprocal marker (if language has one)
- **TBTA marking**: Should mark as **Reciprocal (R)**, NOT reflexive

**Theological significance**: Central to Christian ethics - mutual love command. Reciprocal must be clear and unambiguous.

**Sources**:
- Greek text: https://biblehub.com/interlinear/john/13-34.htm
- Reciprocal pronoun: https://christianleaders.org/mod/page/view.php?id=33586

**Citation Code**: {john-13-34-reciprocal}

---

### Case Study 2: Ephesians 5:21 - "Submit to One Another" (Reciprocal Middle)

**Greek text**: ὑποτασσόμενοι ἀλλήλοις (*hypotassomenoi allēlois*)

**Analysis**:
- **ὑποτασσόμενοι** (*hypotassomenoi*): Present middle participle, "submitting"
- **ἀλλήλοις** (*allēlois*): Reciprocal pronoun, dative plural, "to one another"
- **Construction**: Middle voice verb + explicit reciprocal pronoun

**Middle voice significance**:
- Greek grammar calls this **"reciprocal middle"**
- Middle voice suggests action is mutual/reciprocal
- Confirmed by presence of ἀλλήλοις (allēlois)

**Translation implications**:
- Must convey **mutual submission** concept
- Some languages may mark both:
  - Reciprocal marker (for "one another")
  - Middle/reflexive verb marker (for middle voice)
- English uses only reciprocal pronoun ("to one another")

**Theological debate**: Extent of reciprocity
- Does "one another" mean complete mutuality (everyone to everyone)?
- Or selective reciprocity within appropriate relationships?
- Context (Eph 5:22ff) specifies household relationships

**Sources**:
- Middle voice analysis: https://margmowczko.com/ephesians-521-mutual/
- Greek grammar: https://www.preceptaustin.org/ephesians_521-22

**Citation Code**: {eph-5-21-reciprocal-middle}

---

### Case Study 3: Galatians 2:20 - "Gave Himself" (Reflexive Pronoun)

**Greek text**: παραδόντος ἑαυτόν (*paradontos heauton*)

**Analysis**:
- **παραδόντος** (*paradontos*): Aorist active participle (NOT middle voice), "having given"
- **ἑαυτόν** (*heauton*): Reflexive pronoun, accusative masculine singular, "himself"
- **Construction**: Active verb + explicit reflexive pronoun

**Significance**:
- Uses ACTIVE voice with reflexive pronoun, NOT middle voice
- Why? Emphasizes voluntary, deliberate self-giving
- Middle voice would suggest natural/expected action
- Active + reflexive = emphatic self-sacrifice

**Translation implications**:
- Languages must convey reflexive ("himself" not "him")
- Emphasis on voluntary action critical for Christology
- Some languages may need:
  - Reflexive pronoun (if available)
  - Reflexive verb marker
  - Emphatic construction

**Theological significance**:
- Central to atonement theology
- Christ's voluntary self-giving for salvation
- Reflexive must be clear: He gave HIMSELF (not another)

**Sources**:
- Greek text: https://biblehub.com/lexicon/galatians/2-20.htm
- Commentary: https://www.preceptaustin.org/galatians_220

**Citation Code**: {gal-2-20-reflexive}

### Case Study 4: Matthew 6:29 - "Clothed Himself" (Reflexive Middle)

**Greek text**: περιεβάλετο (*periebaleto*)

**Analysis**:
- **περιεβάλετο** (*periebaleto*): Aorist middle indicative, 3rd singular, "he clothed (himself)"
- **Construction**: Middle voice alone (no explicit reflexive pronoun)
- **Function**: Direct reflexive middle - "Solomon clothed himself"

**Middle voice interpretation**:
- Naturally reflexive event (grooming/body care)
- Greek uses middle voice without pronoun
- English adds "himself" for clarity

**Translation implications**:
- Languages with reflexive verb markers: Use reflexive marker
- Languages with reflexive pronouns: May add pronoun even though Greek doesn't have it
- Languages with zero-marking: May leave unmarked (context clear)

**Comparison**: English could say "Solomon dressed" (zero reflexive) but "clothed himself" is clearer

**Source**: Referenced in https://koine-greek.com/2018/03/31/active-reflexive-vs-middle-voice-whats-the-difference/

**Citation Code**: {matt-6-29-middle-reflexive}

---

### Case Study 5: Matthew 16:7 - "Discussed Among Themselves" (Reciprocal Middle)

**Greek text**: διελογίζοντο (*dielogizonto*)

**Analysis**:
- **διελογίζοντο** (*dielogizonto*): Imperfect middle indicative, 3rd plural, "they were discussing"
- **Construction**: Middle voice, plural subject, NO explicit reciprocal pronoun
- **Function**: Reciprocal middle - mutual discussion

**Middle voice reciprocal**:
- Plural middle voice implies mutual action
- Context makes reciprocal interpretation clear
- Greek does not require explicit ἀλλήλων (*allēlōn*) "one another"

**Translation implications**:
- English adds "among themselves" to clarify reciprocal
- Languages with obligatory reciprocal marking: Must add marker
- Languages allowing zero-marking: May leave unmarked with plural subject

**Contrast with John 13:34**: Explicit reciprocal pronoun used there for emphasis/clarity

**Source**: Referenced in https://www.newtestamentgreek.net/unveiling-middle-voice-agency-reciprocality-and-subject-involvement-in-koine-greek.html

**Citation Code**: {matt-16-7-reciprocal-middle}

---

### Case Study 6: 1 Corinthians 13:8 - "Will Cease" (Deponent Middle)

**Greek text**: παύσονται (*pausontai*)

**Analysis**:
- **παύσονται** (*pausontai*): Future middle indicative, 3rd plural, "they will cease"
- **Construction**: Middle voice form
- **Function**: Deponent OR indirect middle

**Debate**:
- **Traditional view** (Wallace): Deponent verb, active meaning "will cease"
- **Middle voice interpretation**: "Will cease of their own accord" (intransitive middle)
- Not reflexive: Tongues don't "cease themselves" as object

**Wallace's interpretation**:
- "Tongues will cease of their own accord, i.e., 'die out' without an intervening agent" (indirect middle)
- OR simply deponent with no middle force

**TBTA implication**:
- Should mark as **N (not applicable)**, not reflexive
- Even though morphologically middle voice
- Semantic function is NOT reflexive or reciprocal
