# SECTION 1: NON-ARBITRARY (Theologically Critical)
non_arbitrary_contexts:
  - verse_pattern: 'Divine Commands (Ten Commandments, Torah Law)'
    example_verses: 'Exodus 20:1-17, Deuteronomy 5:6-21 (unverified)'
    affected_values: [imperative, jussive, prohibition]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Divine authority
      - Ethics and morality
      - Law and grace
      - Obedience to God

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Hebrew imperatives and jussives in divine law express God's authoritative commands.
      Reducing imperative "You shall not murder" to indicative "You will not murder"
      changes a divine command into a mere prediction, undermining the binding nature
      of God's moral law. The grammatical mood reflects theological reality: God commands,
      not merely suggests or predicts.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: imperative
      acceptable_alternatives: [jussive, prohibition-modal]
      forbidden_values: [indicative, optative]  # Changes command to prediction/wish
      theological_basis: 'God speaks with absolute authority; commands must retain imperatival force'
      translator_guidance: |
        FIRST CHOICE: Use strongest imperative/command form in target language
        SECOND CHOICE: If no grammatical imperative, use obligation modal ("must")
        FORBIDDEN: Indicative future tense (changes command to prediction)
        FORBIDDEN: Optative/wish ("may you not...") - weakens divine authority

  - verse_pattern: 'Greek Conditional Sentences (First Class - Assumed True)'
    example_verses: 'Romans 8:31, 1 John 1:9, Matthew 12:27-28 (unverified)'
    affected_values: [indicative-in-protasis, subjunctive]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Soteriology (salvation assurance)
      - Pneumatology (Spirit's work)
      - Theodicy (God's faithfulness)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Greek first-class conditions (εἰ + indicative) assume the condition is true
      for argument's sake. "If we confess our sins [assuming we do], He is faithful"
      (1 John 1:9) has different force than third-class condition (subjunctive) which
      expresses uncertainty. Translating first-class as uncertain weakens assurance
      of salvation promises.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: indicative  # In protasis of first-class conditions
      acceptable_alternatives: [assumptive-particle]
      forbidden_values: [subjunctive]  # Changes assumed truth to uncertainty
      theological_basis: 'First-class conditions assert theological certainty for rhetorical effect'
      translator_guidance: |
        FIRST CHOICE: "Since we confess..." or "When we confess..." (assumes reality)
        SECOND CHOICE: "If we confess..." with strong assumptive particle
        FORBIDDEN: Subjunctive mood suggesting doubt about confession occurring
        NOTE: Distinguish from second-class (contrary to fact) and third-class (uncertain)

  - verse_pattern: 'Greek Conditional Sentences (Second Class - Contrary to Fact)'
    example_verses: 'John 15:22, John 15:24, Galatians 1:10 (unverified)'

    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christology (uniqueness of Christ)
      - Sin and guilt
      - Apostolic authority

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Second-class conditions (εἰ + indicative, ἄν + indicative) assert the opposite
      of reality. "If I were still pleasing men [but I'm not], I would not be a servant
      of Christ" (Gal 1:10). Losing this contrary-to-fact force changes Paul's clear
      denial into ambiguous statement.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: contrary-to-fact-indicative
      acceptable_alternatives: [contrafactual-modal]
      forbidden_values: [simple-conditional]  # Loses the "but it's not true" assertion
      theological_basis: 'Contrary-to-fact conditions make theological assertions by negation'
      translator_guidance: |
        FIRST CHOICE: "If X were true (but it's not)..."
        SECOND CHOICE: Use target language's contrafactual mood/particle
        FORBIDDEN: Generic "if...then" (obscures the negation)

  - verse_pattern: 'Sermon on the Mount Imperatives'
    example_verses: 'Matthew 5:3-7:27, Luke 6:20-49 (unverified)'

    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christian ethics
      - Discipleship
      - Kingdom values
      - Jesus as authoritative teacher

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Jesus' imperatives in Sermon on Mount ("Love your enemies", "Do not judge",
      "Seek first the kingdom") are authoritative kingdom commands, not suggestions.
      Weakening imperative force undermines Jesus' authority as divine teacher and
      makes kingdom ethics optional rather than binding.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: imperative
      acceptable_alternatives: [strong-obligation-modal]
      forbidden_values: [optative, hortatory-suggestion]
      theological_basis: 'Jesus speaks with divine authority; His commands are binding on disciples'
      translator_guidance: |
        FIRST CHOICE: Direct imperative in target language
        SECOND CHOICE: "You must..." if imperatives are too harsh culturally
        FORBIDDEN: "You should..." or "It would be good to..." (makes commands optional)
        NOTE: Distinguish direct imperatives from wisdom sayings (Beatitudes are indicative)

  - verse_pattern: 'Pauline Optative Benedictions'
    example_verses: 'Romans 15:5, 15:13, 15:33, 2 Thessalonians 3:16, Galatians 6:16 (unverified)'

      - Prayer theology
      - Divine blessing
      - Apostolic authority
      - God's sovereignty in sanctification

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Greek optative mood in Paul's benedictions ("May the God of peace...") expresses
      prayer-wish for God to act, not command. Changing to imperative ("God of peace,
      do this!") wrongly makes prayer into command to God. Changing to simple future
      ("God will give peace") loses the prayer dimension and makes it mere prediction.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: optative
      acceptable_alternatives: [jussive, benedictive-formula]
      forbidden_values: [imperative-to-God, simple-future-indicative]
      theological_basis: 'Prayer expresses desire for God to act, not command; optative preserves prayer mood'
      translator_guidance: |
        FIRST CHOICE: "May God..." or "May the Lord..." (optative/jussive wish)
        SECOND CHOICE: "Let God..." if optative not available
        FORBIDDEN: Imperative addressed to God (theologically inappropriate)
        FORBIDDEN: Simple future "God will..." (loses prayer dimension)

  - verse_pattern: 'Genesis 1:26 Cohortative (Trinity Hint)'
    example_verses: 'Genesis 1:26, Genesis 3:22, Genesis 11:7, Isaiah 6:8 (unverified)'
    affected_values: [cohortative, jussive, hortatory-plural]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Trinity (pre-incarnate Christology)
      - Divine counsel
      - Image of God

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Hebrew cohortative "Let us make" (na'aseh) is plural first-person, suggesting
      divine plurality. While not proof of Trinity alone, it's consistent with Trinitarian
      understanding when combined with monotheism. Translating as singular "Let me make"
      or as addressing angels removes this textual hint toward plurality in Godhead.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: cohortative-plural
      acceptable_alternatives: [hortatory-we]
      forbidden_values: [singular-cohortative, imperative-to-angels]
      theological_basis: 'Plural cohortative preserves textual hint toward divine plurality (Trinity)'

        SECOND CHOICE: "We will make..." if cohortative not available
        FORBIDDEN: "Let me make..." (removes plurality)
        FORBIDDEN: "Let them make..." (changes subject from God)
        NOTE: Include footnote explaining plural as intra-divine counsel

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Plural of majesty (purely stylistic)'
        used_by: [some Jewish interpretations, Islamic scholars]
        christian_assessment: POSSIBLE_BUT_INSUFFICIENT (plural is real, but better explained by Trinity)
      - interpretation: 'God addressing angels'
        used_by: [some rabbinic sources, Philo]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (angels don't co-create; humans made in God's image not angels')

    affected_doctrines:
      - Messianic prophecy
      - Divine foreknowledge
      - Inerrancy of prophecy
      - Christology

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Hebrew prophetic perfect uses completed-action aspect for future events to express
      absolute certainty: "A child is born" (Isaiah 9:6) for future Messiah. Translating
      as tentative future ("might be born") or conditional undermines prophetic certainty
      and divine foreknowledge. God speaks of future as accomplished fact.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: perfect-as-certain-future
      acceptable_alternatives: [strong-future-indicative]
      forbidden_values: [conditional, uncertain-modal]
      theological_basis: 'God's foreknowledge is certain; prophetic perfect reflects divine perspective'
      translator_guidance: |
        FIRST CHOICE: Present tense "A child is born" (preserves prophetic certainty)
        SECOND CHOICE: Definite future "will be born" with certainty marker
        FORBIDDEN: "May be born" or "could be born" (introduces doubt)
        NOTE: English present tense often best captures Hebrew prophetic perfect force

  - verse_pattern: 'Purpose/Result Clauses (ἵνα/ὅπως + Subjunctive)'

    affected_values: [subjunctive, purpose, result]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Soteriology (God's saving purpose)
      - Divine election
      - Eschatology

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Greek purpose clauses with subjunctive express God's intent: "that whoever believes
      in Him should not perish" (John 3:16). Losing subjunctive's purpose nuance can
      obscure whether verse teaches result only or divine purpose. Critical for election,
      predestination debates.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: subjunctive-purpose
      acceptable_alternatives: [purpose-infinitive, "in-order-that"]
      forbidden_values: [simple-result-indicative]
      theological_basis: 'ἵνα + subjunctive expresses God\'s purposeful intent, not mere result'
      translator_guidance: |
        FIRST CHOICE: "so that" or "in order that" (explicit purpose)
        SECOND CHOICE: Purpose infinitive "to save all who believe"
        FORBIDDEN: Simple result "therefore he does not perish" (loses purpose)
        NOTE: Distinguish telic (purpose) from ecbatic (result) uses

  - verse_pattern: 'Prayer Language (Lord\'s Prayer)'

    affected_values: [imperative, jussive, petition-optative]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Prayer theology
      - Kingdom eschatology
      - Relation to God (Father)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Imperative petitions "hallowed be Your name" and "give us this day" express proper
      prayer posture before God. Using indicative ("Your name is hallowed") makes it
      statement of fact rather than petition. Using weak optative ("may it perhaps be")
      undermines boldness Jesus encourages in prayer.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: imperative-petition
      acceptable_alternatives: [jussive-wish]
      forbidden_values: [indicative-statement, tentative-optative]
      theological_basis: 'Jesus teaches bold, direct petitions to Father; imperatives reflect this'
      translator_guidance: |
        FIRST CHOICE: Imperative/jussive "hallowed be" (direct petition)
        SECOND CHOICE: "May Your name be hallowed" (jussive wish)
        FORBIDDEN: "Your name is hallowed" (removes petition)
        FORBIDDEN: "Perhaps Your name could be hallowed" (too tentative)

  - verse_pattern: 'Great Commission Commands'
    example_verses: 'Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:15-16, Acts 1:8 (unverified)'

      - Missiology (missions mandate)
      - Ecclesiology (church purpose)
      - Discipleship
      - Christ's authority

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Greek imperatives "Go" (πορευθέντες participle) and "make disciples" (μαθητεύσατε
      imperative) constitute Christ's authoritative commission to church. Weakening to
      suggestions ("You could make disciples") undermines missions mandate and Christ's
      final command authority.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: imperative
      acceptable_alternatives: [strong-command-form]
      forbidden_values: [optative, suggestion, conditional-permission]
      theological_basis: 'Christ\'s final command is binding on all Christians; imperative is non-negotiable'
      translator_guidance: |
        FIRST CHOICE: Direct imperative "Go and make disciples"
        SECOND CHOICE: "You must go and make disciples"
        FORBIDDEN: "You should consider making disciples" (makes it optional)
        FORBIDDEN: "If you want, make disciples" (removes command force)
        NOTE: Recognize πορευθέντες as attendant circumstance, not separate command

  - verse_pattern: 'Gethsemane Prayer (Optative + Imperative Tension)'

    affected_values: [optative, imperative, conditional]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christology (Jesus' humanity and deity)
      - Atonement (Jesus' willing sacrifice)
      - Prayer (submission to God's will)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Jesus' prayer shows tension: wish/desire ("if possible, let this cup pass") with
      submission ("yet not my will but yours"). Getting mood wrong could suggest either
      that Jesus commanded the Father, or that He was uncertain/reluctant about atonement.
      Mood preserves both human reluctance and divine submission.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: optative-with-conditional
      acceptable_alternatives: [polite-request-form]
      forbidden_values: [direct-imperative-to-Father, indicative-statement]

        SECOND CHOICE: "If possible, may this cup pass"
        FORBIDDEN: "Remove this cup!" (direct imperative - theologically inappropriate)
        FORBIDDEN: "This cup will pass" (indicative removes prayer/petition)

  - verse_pattern: 'Apocalyptic Commands (Revelation)'
    example_verses: 'Revelation 22:17, Revelation 22:20, Revelation 3:20 (unverified)'
    affected_values: [imperative, jussive, invitation]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Eschatology (Christ's return)
      - Soteriology (gospel invitation)
      - Free will and response

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Apocalyptic imperatives function as urgent invitations: "Come!" (Rev 22:17).
      These are gracious invitations requiring response, not coercive commands.
      Too weak (optative "you might come") loses urgency; too strong (military command)
      loses gracious invitation character.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: imperative-invitation
      acceptable_alternatives: [urgent-invitation-form]

# SECTION 2: ARBITRARY (Stylistic/Contextual)
arbitrary_contexts:
  - pattern: "Narrative indicatives (historical storytelling)"
    rationale: |
      Most narrative verbs simply state facts: "Jesus went," "Peter said," "They arrived."
      Mood choice is dictated by narrative genre conventions, not theology. Whether Greek
      uses indicative, Hebrew uses waw-consecutive, or English uses simple past makes no
      doctrinal difference.
    estimated_percentage: 70%
    examples: 'Most of Gospels, Acts, historical books (unverified)'

  - pattern: "Descriptive statements about God's attributes"
    rationale: |
      Indicative mood for stating facts about God: "God is love," "He is faithful."
      These are straightforward predications where mood is determined by grammar,
      not theological importance.
    estimated_percentage: 10%
    examples: '1 John 4:8, Psalm 136, doctrinal statements (unverified)'

  - pattern: "Questions seeking information"
    rationale: |
      Interrogative mood/syntax varies by language. "Where are you going?" vs
      "Where might you be going?" is stylistic, not theological. Even rhetorical
      questions' mood is largely stylistic.
    estimated_percentage: 3%
    examples: 'Most interrogatives in dialogue (unverified)'

  - pattern: "Participial phrases (temporal, causal, manner)"
    rationale: |
      Most participles function as adjectives or adverbial modifiers: "walking by the sea,"
      "having heard this." Their aspectual/modal force is contextual, not theologically
      determined.
    estimated_percentage: 8%
    examples: 'Adverbial participles throughout NT (unverified)'

  - pattern: "Subjunctive in generic conditional protases"
    rationale: |
      Third-class conditions expressing general uncertainty ("If anyone wants to follow")
      use subjunctive by grammatical convention. Not theologically loaded unless specific
      doctrine involved.
    estimated_percentage: 4%
    examples: 'Generic "if anyone" conditions (unverified)'

  - pattern: "Wishes and blessings (non-authoritative)"
    rationale: |
      Personal wishes, greetings, farewells using optative or jussive mood are culturally
      conventional: "May you prosper" (3 John 2). Not theologically critical unless
      apostolic blessing.
    estimated_percentage: 2%
    examples: 'Letter greetings/closings, personal wishes (unverified)'

  - pattern: "Infinitives in purpose clauses (non-soteriological)"
    rationale: |
      Purpose infinitives expressing mundane purposes: "He went to buy bread," "They came
      to see Him." Purpose is clear, mood/form is stylistic.
    estimated_percentage: 3%
    examples: 'Everyday purpose statements (unverified)'

notes: |
  - All verse references marked (unverified) - based on internal knowledge requiring validation
  - Greek conditional system (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th class) is particularly high-stakes
  - Hebrew verbal system (perfect/imperfect) maps to mood/aspect differently than Greek
  - Imperative mood in divine speech is almost always non-arbitrary
  - Optative mood is rare in Koine Greek but theologically significant when present
  - Distinguish grammatical mood from modal auxiliaries in target languages
  - Consider both source language mood AND target language functional equivalents
