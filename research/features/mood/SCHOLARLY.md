# Research: Mood

## Executive Summary

Mood is a grammatical category expressing the speaker's stance toward the reality, certainty, or desirability of a proposition. Cross-linguistically, languages employ diverse strategies: Indo-European languages typically distinguish indicative (realis) from subjunctive/optative (irrealis), while many languages of the Americas and Papua New Guinea use realis/irrealis markers. Biblical Greek exhibits four moods (indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative), while Biblical Hebrew employs a deontic/volitional system (imperative, jussive, cohortative). The key theological challenge for Bible translation lies in rendering modal distinctions that may not exist in target languages, particularly Greek subjunctives expressing purpose/probability, optatives expressing wishes/prayers, and Hebrew cohortatives expressing divine intention (Genesis 1:26). Palmer's (2001) typology distinguishes propositional modality (epistemic, evidential) from event modality (deontic, dynamic), while van der Auwera & Plungian's (1998) semantic map traces crosslinguistic grammaticalization pathways from participant-internal → participant-external → epistemic modality.

## 1. Scholarly Sources

### Palmer, F.R. (2001). _Mood and Modality_ (2nd ed.). Cambridge University Press
- **Key Findings**:
  - Mood traditionally restricted to verbal morphology; modality includes modal verbs (can, may, must)
  - Propositional modality: epistemic (speaker's judgment of factual status) and evidential (evidence type)
  - Event modality: deontic (external conditioning factors—permission, obligation) and dynamic (internal factors—ability, volition)
  - Realis/irrealis distinction parallels indicative/subjunctive but appears in typologically different languages
  - European languages show high overlap between situational and epistemic modals; elsewhere overlap is rare

## 2. Typological Databases

### WALS Feature 75: Epistemic Possibility
- **Source**: de Haan, Ferdinand (2013). "Coding of Epistemic Modality." In Dryer & Haspelmath (eds.), _WALS Online_ (v2020.3)
- **URL**: https://wals.info/chapter/75
- **Values**:
  - Verbal constructions (modals like English "may/might")
  - Affixes on verbs
  - Other constructions (particles, adverbs)
- **Geographic Distribution**:
  - Verbal constructions: Common in Europe; almost unattested in New Guinea/Australia; zero in Americas
  - Affixes: Preferred in New Guinea
  - Other markers: Dominant in Pacific languages
- **Implication for Algorithm**: Greek modal verbs (δύναμαι, μέλλω) fit European pattern; absence in many target languages requires periphrastic strategies. Predict difficulties translating Greek modal verbs to languages using affixes/particles.

### WALS Feature 76: Overlap between Situational and Epistemic Modal Marking
- **Source**: de Haan, Ferdinand (2013). "Overlap between Situational and Epistemic Modal Marking." In Dryer & Haspelmath (eds.), _WALS Online_ (v2020.3)
- **URL**: https://wals.info/chapter/76
- **Values**:
  - High overlap (same marker for both situational and epistemic)
  - Some overlap (partial polysemy)
  - No overlap (distinct markers)
- **Geographic Distribution**:
  - High overlap: Characteristic of Europe ONLY; nearly all European languages
  - No overlap: Majority outside Europe (Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Americas)
  - Some overlap: Sporadic in Asia; absent in Africa/Americas
- **Implication for Algorithm**: Greek modal overlap (δύναμαι = "can/may") typical of European pattern. Translating to non-European languages may require splitting one Greek form into multiple target language forms. Predict need for contextual disambiguation algorithms.

### WALS Feature 69A: Position of Tense-Aspect Affixes
- **Note**: While WALS has extensive tense-aspect coverage, specific "position of modal markers" feature not found in search results. Feature 69-71 cover tense-aspect affix position, future tenses, perfect aspect.
- **Implication**: Modal marking position varies crosslinguistically; Hebrew suffix-based volitionals vs. Greek stem-internal ablaut requires different parsing strategies.

### WALS Feature 71A: The Prohibitive
- **Source**: van der Auwera, Johan & Vossen, Frens (2016). "The Prohibitive." In Dryer & Haspelmath (eds.), _WALS Online_ (v2020.3)
- **URL**: https://wals.info/chapter/71A
- **Implication**: Greek μή + subjunctive vs. μή + imperative prohibitive strategies can be compared typologically. Many languages use different negators for prohibitive vs. declarative negation.

## 3. Translation Case Studies

### Greek Subjunctive in Purpose Clauses: John 3:16
- **Source Text**: ἵνα πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων εἰς αὐτὸν μὴ ἀπόληται ἀλλ' ἔχῃ ζωὴν αἰώνιον
- **Feature Handling**: Subjunctive after ἵνα (purpose/result clause); most common use of subjunctive (1/3 of all NT subjunctives)
- **Specific Challenge**:
  - ἀπόληται (aorist subjunctive, 3rd person): "should not perish" (potential negative outcome)
  - ἔχῃ (present subjunctive, 3rd person): "might have" (potential positive outcome)
  - Subjunctive expresses purpose/intended result, not certainty
- **Translation Strategies**:
  - Formal: "in order that everyone believing...might not perish but might have"
  - Dynamic: "so that everyone who believes...will not perish but have" (shifts to indicative certainty)
  - Languages lacking subjunctive: Use modal verbs ("should/would"), purpose particles, or indicative with purpose conjunction
- **Insight**: Purpose clause subjunctives often neutralized to indicatives in translation, losing Greek's subtle uncertainty/potentiality marking. Critical for theological nuance: does divine purpose guarantee outcome or merely express intention?

### Greek Optative in Benedictions: Romans 15:13
- **Source Text**: ὁ δὲ θεὸς τῆς ἐλπίδος πληρώσαι ὑμᾶς πάσης χαρᾶς καὶ εἰρήνης
- **Feature Handling**: Optative of wish/prayer (voluntative optative)
- **Specific Challenge**:
  - πληρώσαι (aorist active optative, 3rd person): "may [God] fill you"
  - Only 68 optatives in NT; 15 are stereotyped μὴ γένοιτο ("God forbid!")
  - Benedictions used optative for formal, religious register
- **Translation Strategies**:
  - Formal: "May the God of hope fill you"
  - Many modern versions: "Now may the God of hope fill you" (adds "now" for formality)
  - Languages lacking optative: Use imperative to deity ("God, fill them"), jussive ("Let God fill"), or indicative with blessing particle
- **Insight**: Optative's rarity and declining use by NT period means many instances are formulaic. Translation must balance: (1) wish/prayer semantics, (2) formal/elevated register, (3) blessing genre conventions in target language.

### Hebrew Cohortative in Divine Speech: Genesis 1:26
- **Source Text**: וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים נַעֲשֶׂה אָדָם בְּצַלְמֵנוּ כִּדְמוּתֵנוּ
- **Feature Handling**: 1st person plural cohortative expressing divine intention/resolve
- **Specific Challenge**:
  - נַעֲשֶׂה (Qal cohortative, 1st common plural): "Let us make"
  - Plural form theologically significant: Trinity? Angelic court? Plural of majesty? Plural of fullness?
  - Cohortative expresses determination, personal interest in action (vs. mere announcement)
  - Waltke-O'Connor: cohortative never used with plural of majesty
- **Translation Strategies**:
  - Standard: "Let us make man in our image" (preserves 1st plural + cohortative volitional sense)
  - Some versions: "I will make" (theological interpretation removing plurality)
  - Exegetical issues: Does cohortative indicate deliberation/consultation, or internal divine resolve?
- **Insight**: Cohortative adds modal nuance of intention/determination beyond simple future. Theologically loaded: suppressing cohortative volitional force to resolve plurality removes grammatical evidence for divine counsel. Translation must preserve both plurality AND volitional mood.

### Conditional Sentences and Mood: Matthew 6:14-15
- **Source Text**: ἐὰν γὰρ ἀφῆτε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὰ παραπτώματα αὐτῶν, ἀφήσει καὶ ὑμῖν ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος
- **Feature Handling**: Third-class condition (ἐάν + subjunctive in protasis; future indicative in apodosis)
- **Specific Challenge**:
  - ἀφῆτε (aorist subjunctive, 2nd plural): "if you forgive" (probable/potential condition)
  - ἀφήσει (future indicative, 3rd singular): "will forgive" (certain result)
  - Third-class condition: may or may not happen, probable but uncertain
- **Translation Strategies**:
  - English naturally handles this with "if" + present/aorist (loses subjunctive mood marking)
  - Languages with conditional moods: Map subjunctive to conditional marker
  - Languages with realis/irrealis: Protasis = irrealis, apodosis = realis
- **Insight**: Greek preserves mood distinction (subjunctive protasis, indicative apodosis) marking probability gradient. Most translations collapse to single conditional marker, losing Greek's morphological certainty distinction.

## 4. Key Biblical Verses for Mood Analysis

### Imperatives in Sermon on Mount (Matthew 5-7)

**Matthew 5:16** - Third-person imperative
- λαμψάτω τὸ φῶς ὑμῶν ("let your light shine")
- Greek third-person imperative rare in English; translated with "let"
- Potential misunderstanding: sounds permissive rather than commanding
- Translation must preserve imperative force despite "let" auxiliary

**Matthew 5:17** - Prohibition with aorist subjunctive
- μὴ νομίσητε ὅτι ἦλθον καταλῦσαι ("do not think that I came to abolish")
- Standard Greek prohibition: μή + aorist subjunctive
- Contrasts with present imperative prohibition (ongoing action)
- Aorist: "don't start thinking" vs. present: "stop thinking"

**Matthew 5:48** - Future indicative as imperative
- ἔσεσθε οὖν ὑμεῖς τέλειοι ("you will be perfect")
- Future indicative functioning imperatively in some interpretations
- Debate: command or promise/prophecy?

**Matthew 6:9-13** - Lord's Prayer imperatives
- ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου ("hallowed be your name") - aorist passive imperative, 3rd singular
- ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου ("let your kingdom come") - aorist active imperative, 3rd singular
- γενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου ("let your will be done") - aorist passive imperative, 3rd singular
- δὸς ἡμῖν σήμερον ("give us today") - aorist active imperative, 2nd singular
- ἄφες ἡμῖν ("forgive us") - aorist active imperative, 2nd singular
- Translation challenge: Preserving petition force (imperative to God) while maintaining reverence

**Matthew 7:1** - Present imperative prohibition
- Μὴ κρίνετε ("do not judge") - present active imperative, 2nd plural with μή
- Interpreted as: "stop judging" (ongoing action to cease) or "don't make a habit of judging"

### Greek Optative in Pauline Prayers/Wishes

**Romans 15:5** - Prayer for unity
- ὁ δὲ θεὸς...δῴη ὑμῖν ("may God...grant you")
- δῴη: aorist active optative, 3rd singular from δίδωμι

**Romans 15:13** - Benediction (cited above)
- πληρώσαι ὑμᾶς ("may [he] fill you")

**Galatians 6:16** - Peace benediction
- Εἰρήνη ἐπ' αὐτοὺς καὶ ἔλεος ("peace and mercy upon them")
- Verbless; optative understood

**1 Thessalonians 3:11-12** - Extended optative prayer
- Αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ θεὸς...κατευθύναι τὴν ὁδὸν ἡμῶν ("May God...direct our way")
- ὑμᾶς δὲ ὁ κύριος πλεονάσαι καὶ περισσεύσαι ("may the Lord cause you to increase and abound")
