      The semantic role of "God" in creation determines whether:

      - Spirit is **Agent** (co-creator, equal) vs Instrument (mere tool)
      - Word (Logos) is **Agent** vs **Patient** (created) vs Instrument

      Orthodox doctrine requires:
      - God (Father) = Most Agent-like (primary creator)
      - Spirit = Agent-like OR Instrument (hovering, empowering)
      - Word/Logos = Agent-like (John 1:3 "through him all things were made")

      The preposition "through" (δι' αὐτοῦ, di' autou) marks semantic role:
      - **Agent**: Word actively creates (co-equal with Father)
      - **Instrument**: Word is means/tool (but must preserve personhood and agency)
      - **Patient**: Word is created (HERETICAL)

      Orthodox view: "through" indicates instrumental agency - the Word is both Agent and Instrument
      (mediates Father's creative will while exercising own divine power).

      Heretical view: "through" means Word is mere passive conduit (Arianism).
