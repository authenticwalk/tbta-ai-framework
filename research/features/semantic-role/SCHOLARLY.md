# Research: Semantic Role

## Executive Summary

Semantic roles (thematic relations, theta roles) represent the semantic relationship between a verb and its arguments. Since their introduction by Fillmore (1968) and Gruber (1965), semantic roles have been central to understanding the syntax-semantics interface. **Key findings for Bible translation**:

1. **Theoretical consensus**: All frameworks recognize Agent and Patient as core categories with cross-linguistic validity
2. **Prototypicality matters**: Dowty (1991) showed roles are best understood as cluster concepts (Proto-Agent, Proto-Patient) rather than discrete categories
3. **Typological variation**: Languages encode roles through diverse strategies—case systems (Greek, Russian), prepositions (Hebrew, English), voice systems (Tagalog, Swahili), word order (Mandarin)
4. **Translation challenge**: Mapping from case-rich source languages (Greek 5 cases) to case-poor targets (English, Chinese) requires semantic analysis beyond morphology
5. **Biblical language specifics**: Greek's case system explicitly marks roles; Hebrew's prepositional system is highly polysemous and context-dependent

**Theological implication**: Distinguishing Agent from Patient, Beneficiary from Addressee, and Source from Destination is critical for accurate doctrinal interpretation (e.g., who performs vs receives divine action).

## 1. Scholarly Sources

### 1.1 Fillmore, Charles J. (1968). "The Case for Case"

**Publication**: In Bach and Harms (eds.), *Universals in Linguistic Theory*, 1-88. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.

**Key Findings**:
- Introduced "case grammar" with six deep cases: **Agentive** (actor), **Instrumental** (instrument), **Dative** (recipient), **Factitive** (result), **Locative** (location), **Objective** (undergoer)
- Argued syntactic structure is predictable from semantic participants
- Each verb selects a "case frame" describing required semantic roles
- Deep cases are universal, but surface realization varies by language

**Citation Code**: {fillmore-1968-case}

**Relevance**: Foundational for understanding semantic roles as interface between semantics and syntax. TBTA's values (Agent-like, Patient-like, Source, Destination, Instrument, Beneficiary, Addressee) directly descend from Fillmore's framework.

**Publication**: PhD dissertation, MIT. Published 1976 as *Lexical Structures in Syntax and Semantics*, North-Holland.

**Key Findings**:
- Introduced "thematic relations" parallel to Fillmore's case roles
- Emphasized **Theme** (moving/located entity) as distinct from Patient
- Developed spatial/locational metaphors for abstract semantic roles

**Citation Code**: {gruber-1965-lexical}

- Proposed hierarchical organization of roles
- Theta Criterion: Each argument receives exactly one theta role, each theta role is assigned to exactly one argument

**Citation Code**: {jackendoff-1972-semantic}

**Relevance**: Established theta roles in formal syntax. Explains why TBTA assigns one Semantic Role per NP (not multiple).

---

### 1.4 Dowty, David (1991). "Thematic Proto-Roles and Argument Selection"

**Publication**: *Language* 67(3), 547-619.

**Key Findings**:
- **Proto-Agent properties**: volitional involvement, sentience, causing change, movement
- **Proto-Patient properties**: undergoing change, being causally affected, stationary
- Argument Selection Principle: The argument with most Proto-Agent properties becomes subject; most Proto-Patient properties becomes object
- Roles are **cluster concepts**, not discrete categories
- Explains intermediate cases (e.g., Experiencer has some Agent, some Patient properties)

**Citation Code**: {dowty-1991-protoroles}

**Relevance**: **Critical for TBTA**. Explains why "Most Agent-like" and "Most Patient-like" are better labels than discrete "Agent"/"Patient". Supports gradient/prototypical approach.

### 1.5 Van Valin, Robert D. Jr. (1977, 1993). Role and Reference Grammar

**Publication**: PhD dissertation (1977); *Advances in Role and Reference Grammar* (1993), John Benjamins.

**Key Findings**:
- Introduced **semantic macroroles**: **Actor** (generalization over Agent, Experiencer, Instrument) and **Undergoer** (generalization over Patient, Theme, Recipient)
- Macroroles mediate between semantic roles and grammatical relations
- Actor = prototype Agent; Undergoer = prototype Patient
- Voice operations permute macrorole-to-grammatical-relation mapping

**Citation Code**: {vanvalin-1977-rrg}

**Relevance**: Supports TBTA's use of generalized "Agent-like" and "Patient-like" categories. Macroroles parallel TBTA's approach.

### 1.6 Levin, Beth (1993). *English Verb Classes and Alternations*

**Publication**: University of Chicago Press.

**Key Findings**:
- Classified 3000+ English verbs into ~200 semantic classes based on alternation patterns
- Verbs with similar meanings show similar argument realization
- **Hit/Break distinction** (Fillmore 1970): hit verbs (manner) vs break verbs (result) show different alternations
- Argument structure derives from verb semantics

**Citation Code**: {levin-1993-verbclasses}

**Relevance**: Demonstrates verb-specific semantic role assignment. Not all Patients behave identically—creation verbs, destruction verbs, contact verbs differ.

- Languages select from this hierarchy based on voice and transitivity
- Typology of voice systems (active, passive, middle, antipassive)

**Citation Code**: {foley-vanvalin-1984-functional}

**Relevance**: Explains why voice affects semantic role assignment (Greek middle voice, Mayan antipassive). Critical for predicting roles in diverse language types.

---

### 1.12 Zúñiga, Fernando & Kittilä, Seppo (2019). *Grammatical Voice*

**Publication**: Cambridge University Press.

**Key Findings**:

### 1.26 Schlesinger, I.M. (1995). *Cognitive Space and Linguistic Case*

**Publication**: Cambridge University Press.

**Key Findings**:
- Semantic case (deep case) vs surface case distinction
- Localistic hypothesis: abstract roles derive from spatial relations
- Source, Goal, Location as primitive; Agent, Patient as extensions

**Citation Code**: {schlesinger-1995-cognitive}

### 1.27 Palmer, F.R. (2001). *Mood and Modality* (2nd ed.)

**Publication**: Cambridge University Press.

**Key Findings**:
- Modal constructions affect semantic role assignment
- Obligation modals: who is obligated? (Addressee role)
- Permission modals: who grants permission? (Source/Agent role)

**Citation Code**: {palmer-2001-mood}

### 1.28 Brill, JAALL (2024). "Semantic properties of prepositions in Biblical Hebrew"

**Publication**: *Brill's Journal of Afroasiatic Languages and Linguistics* 16(2), 217-246.

**Key Findings**:
- Hebrew מִן (min) "from" marks **dominant causers** (full control over causal chain)
- Hebrew בְּ (be) "in/with" marks **non-dominant causers** (can be altered/prevented)
- Distinction derives from spatial semantics: Source (min) = instigator; Location (be) = proximate cause
- Both mark Agents, Instruments, Reasons—distinction is dominance/control

**Citation Code**: {brill-2024-hebrew-prep}

**Relevance**: **Critical for Hebrew semantic role analysis**. Same surface form (Agent), different semantic nuances. TBTA may need sub-distinctions within "Agent-like" for Hebrew.

### 2.1 WALS Feature 98A: Alignment of Case Marking of Full Noun Phrases

**Source**: World Atlas of Language Structures Online
**URL**: https://wals.info/feature/98A

**Values**:
- Neutral (no case marking)
- Nominative-accusative (standard)
- Nominative-accusative (marked nominative)
- Ergative-absolutive
- Tripartite
- Active-inactive

**Sample Size**: 190 languages

**Implication**:
- **Nominative-accusative**: 82 languages (43%) - Agent and intransitive Subject marked identically (nominative)
- **Ergative-absolutive**: 43 languages (23%) - Patient and intransitive Subject marked identically (absolutive)
- **Neutral**: 33 languages (17%) - No case marking (word order/prepositions)
- **Tripartite**: 4 languages (2%) - Agent, Patient, Subject all marked differently

**TBTA Relevance**: Must distinguish whether target language is nom-acc or erg-abs to correctly map "Agent-like" and "Patient-like" roles.

**Citation Code**: {wals-98a-alignment}

---

### 2.2 WALS Feature 99A: Alignment of Case Marking of Pronouns

**Source**: WALS Online
**URL**: https://wals.info/feature/99A

**Finding**: Pronouns often show different alignment than full NPs.
- Example: Pitjantjatjara (Australian) - nouns are ergative-absolutive, pronouns are nominative-accusative

**Implication**: Cannot assume uniform semantic role marking across all NP types. Personal pronouns may have special case forms.

**Citation Code**: {wals-99a-pronouns}

---

### 2.3 WALS Feature 50A: Asymmetrical Case-Marking

**Source**: WALS Online
**URL**: https://wals.info/chapter/50

**Finding**: 49% of languages show asymmetry in case marking based on:
- **Animacy**: Humans marked differently than inanimates
- **Definiteness**: Definite objects marked (Hebrew אֶת)
- **Person**: 1st/2nd person marked differently than 3rd

**Implication**: Hebrew's differential object marking (אֶת for definite Patients) is typologically common. Affects Patient role identification.

**Citation Code**: {wals-50a-asymmetry}

---

### 2.4 WALS Feature 29A: Syncretism in Verbal Person Marking

**Source**: WALS Online

**Finding**: Polysynthetic languages (Algonquian, Iroquoian, some Papuan) mark Agent and Patient on verb via agreement.

**Implication**: In polysynthetic languages, semantic roles are obligatorily marked morphologically on verb, not just NPs.

**Citation Code**: {wals-29a-person}

---

### 2.5 Grambank: Case (GB020-GB024)

**Source**: Grambank Database
**URL**: https://grambank.clld.org

**Features**:
- GB020: Does the language have case marking?
- GB021: Number of cases
- GB022: Ergative case exists?
- GB023: Nominative case exists?
- GB024: Accusative case exists?

## 3. Translation Case Studies

### 3.1 Achi (acr) - Mayan, Ergative-Absolutive

**Family**: Mayan
**Alignment**: Ergative-absolutive with split based on aspect
**Available in corpus**: Yes (3 versions)

**Feature Handling**:
- **Agent**: Ergative case (Set A markers) for transitive verbs in completive aspect
- **Patient**: Absolutive case (Set B markers) for objects and intransitive subjects
- **Antipassive**: Demotes Patient to oblique, promotes Agent to absolutive
  - Example: X-u-kuna-j "He cured it" (ERG-cure-ABS) → X-kuna-n "He cured" (ANTIP-cure)

**Specific Verse**: Genesis 1:1 "God created the heavens and the earth"
- "God" = Agent → Ergative case
- "heavens and earth" = Patient → Absolutive case

**Insight**: Ergative languages **grammatically require** distinguishing Agent from Patient, but morphological realization is inverted from nominative-accusative languages. TBTA's semantic "Agent-like" and "Patient-like" labels are alignment-neutral.

**Citation**: {campbell-1977-quiche-mayan}

---

### 3.2 Swahili (swa) - Bantu, Applicative Voice

**Family**: Niger-Congo, Bantu
**Feature**: Applicative voice promotes oblique roles to direct object
**Status in corpus**: Not found (need verification—may be listed under different code)

**Feature Handling**:
- **Benefactive applicative**: -i- or -e-
  - Example: Ali-pik-a chakula "Ali cooked food" → Ali-pik-i-a mtoto chakula "Ali cooked [for] child food" (child is now direct object)
- **Instrumental applicative**: -i-/-e-
  - Example: "cut with knife" → "cut-APPL knife bread" (knife promoted to object)
- **Locative applicative**: -i-/-e-
  - Example: "sleep in house" → "sleep-APPL house" (house promoted to object)

**Specific Verse**: 1 John 3:16 "He laid down his life for us"
- "us" = Beneficiary → promoted to direct object via applicative
- TBTA Beneficiary (B) role is core argument, not adjunct

**Insight**: Applicative languages make Beneficiary, Instrument, and Location as grammatically prominent as Patient. TBTA's distinct B (Beneficiary), I (Instrument) codes are essential, not optional.

**Citation**: {Peterson-2007-applicative}

**Source**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_voice

---

### 3.3 Japanese (jpn) - Particles Mark Semantic Roles

**Family**: Japonic
**Feature**: Postpositional particles obligatorily mark semantic roles
**Available in corpus**: Yes (jpn1965)

**Feature Handling**:
| Particle | Semantic Role |
|----------|---------------|
| が (ga) | Agent-like (nominative subject) |
| を (wo) | Patient-like (accusative object) |
| に (ni) | Destination, Addressee, Experiencer (dative) |
| で (de) | Instrument, Location of action |
| から (kara) | Source (ablative) |
| へ (e) / まで (made) | Destination (goal) |
| の (no) | Possessor (genitive) |

**Specific Verse**: John 3:16 "God loved the world"
- "God" = Agent → が (ga) particle
- "world" = Patient → を (wo) particle
- Omitting particles produces ungrammatical/ambiguous sentence

**Insight**: Particles provide explicit semantic role marking comparable to Greek cases. Unlike English, Japanese cannot rely on word order alone. TBTA semantic roles directly correspond to particle choice.
