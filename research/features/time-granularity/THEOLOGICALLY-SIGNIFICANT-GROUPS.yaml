feature: time-granularity
default_classification: arbitrary  # Default: temporal distance is contextual/stylistic
theological_significance: MINIMAL  # Time granularity rarely affects core doctrine

# OVERVIEW
# Time granularity (temporal remoteness) is almost entirely ARBITRARY from a theological
# perspective. The question "how long ago did this happen?" rarely affects doctrine.
#
# CRITICAL DISTINCTION: The *fact* that something happened (historicity) is theologically
# critical, but the *distance* in time is usually not. Genesis creation being "ancient"
# vs "legendary" doesn't change the doctrine of creation - God created, regardless of
# how we measure temporal distance.
#
# However, there are a few CONTEXTUAL cases where time granularity could mislead readers
# if chosen incorrectly - these are listed as non-arbitrary CONTEXTUAL issues, not
# theological ones.

# SECTION 1: NON-ARBITRARY (Contextually Important, Not Theologically Critical)
non_arbitrary_contexts:
  - verse_pattern: 'Immediate prophetic fulfillment (e.g., Matthew 2:15, "Out of Egypt I called my son") (unverified)'
    affected_values: [historic-past, timeless]
    theological_stakes: LOW
    affected_doctrines:
      - Prophecy fulfillment (interpretive accuracy, not core doctrine)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      The original prophecy (Hosea 11:1) was about historic past (Exodus).
      Matthew's quotation applies it to recent past (Jesus' childhood).
      Using "timeless" might obscure the historical anchoring.
      Using same time granularity for both might confuse referents.

      HOWEVER: This affects interpretation clarity, not core doctrine.
      Christian orthodoxy affirms prophecy fulfillment regardless of how
      temporal distance is marked in translation.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: historic-past  # for original Hosea reference
      acceptable_alternatives: [recent-past, timeless-principle]
      forbidden_values: []  # No forbidden values - this is contextual, not doctrinal
      theological_basis: 'Prophecy-fulfillment typology is real but temporal marking is not doctrinally determinative.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - PREFERRED: Mark original prophecy as historic past (Exodus), fulfillment as recent past (Jesus)
        - ACCEPTABLE: Use timeless if language lacks remoteness or for theological application
        - NOT HERETICAL: Any choice that maintains historical connection
        - CONTEXTUAL: This helps readers track referents, but doesn't affect salvation doctrine

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: []  # No non-orthodox alternatives for this feature

  - verse_pattern: 'Recent vs. remote past in narrative chains (e.g., flashbacks, recollections) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [immediate-past, recent-past, historic-past]
    theological_stakes: LOW
    affected_doctrines:
      - Narrative coherence (reader comprehension, not doctrine)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      When a character recounts recent events within a narrative (e.g., "yesterday we..."),
      the time granularity should reflect the CHARACTER'S temporal perspective (yesterday),
      not the READER'S perspective (thousands of years ago).

      Incorrect choice creates confusion but doesn't affect theology.

      Example: Joseph's brothers in Genesis 42:13 - "Yesterday we were in Canaan"
      - From brothers' perspective: RECENT PAST (yesterday/days ago)
      - From reader's perspective: HISTORIC PAST (thousands of years ago)
      - Correct choice: Brothers' perspective (recent past in their discourse)
      - Wrong choice: Reader's perspective → confuses narrative flow but not doctrine

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: character-perspective-time  # Follow speaker's temporal frame
      acceptable_alternatives: [narrative-relative-time]
      forbidden_values: []  # No forbidden values
      theological_basis: 'Accurate narrative representation honors Scripture''s integrity, but temporal framing doesn''t determine doctrine.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - PREFERRED: In direct discourse, use character's temporal perspective
        - NARRATOR VOICE: Use reader's historical perspective (historic past)
        - CHARACTER VOICE: Use speaker's temporal perspective (immediate/recent past)
        - REASON: Maintains discourse coherence and naturalness
        - NOT DOCTRINAL: Reader confusion is pedagogical issue, not theological error

  - verse_pattern: 'Timeless teaching vs. historical narrative (e.g., Sermon on Mount, Proverbs) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [timeless, historic-past]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Application of Scripture (timelessness of God''s truth)
      - Hermeneutics (eternal principles vs historical events)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Jesus' teachings (Sermon on Mount, parables) contain TIMELESS PRINCIPLES
      even though the teaching EVENT occurred ~2000 years ago.

      CRITICAL DISTINCTION:
      - The act of teaching: HISTORIC PAST (Jesus spoke ~2000 years ago)
      - The content of teaching: TIMELESS (principles still apply today)

      Incorrect handling could suggest teachings are outdated or culturally bound
      rather than eternally applicable. This affects APPLICATION more than
      core doctrine, but is important for Christian life.

      Example: Matthew 5:3 - "Blessed are the poor in spirit"
      - Frame: "Jesus said" = HISTORIC PAST
      - Content: "Blessed are..." = TIMELESS PRINCIPLE
      - Wrong: Marking teaching content as historic past → suggests obsolescence
      - Correct: Marking teaching content as timeless → emphasizes ongoing validity

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: timeless  # For teaching content itself
      acceptable_alternatives: [present-general]  # If language lacks timeless/gnomic
      forbidden_values: []  # Even "wrong" choice (historic past) isn't heretical
      theological_basis: 'God''s Word is "living and active" (Hebrews 4:12), eternally applicable. Temporal framing supports but doesn''t determine this truth.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - TEACHING CONTENT: Use timeless/gnomic aspect if available
        - NARRATIVE FRAME: "Jesus said" can be historic past
        - DOCTRINAL STATEMENTS: Timeless (e.g., "God is love")
        - COMMANDS: Timeless application (e.g., "Love your neighbor")
        - PARABLES: Mixed - frame is historic, principle is timeless
        - EPISTLES: Doctrinal sections timeless, narrative sections historic
        - NOT HERETICAL: Using historic past for teachings doesn't deny their authority
        - PRACTICAL: Timeless marking helps readers apply Scripture today

  - verse_pattern: 'Eschatological prophecy (future from original perspective, past from Christian perspective) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [future, historic-past, timeless]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Prophecy fulfillment (Messianic prophecies)
      - Eschatology (end times, already-not yet)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Old Testament prophecies about Messiah are FUTURE from Isaiah's perspective
      but HISTORIC PAST from Christian perspective (fulfilled in Jesus).

      Translation choice affects whether readers see prophecy-fulfillment connection.

      Example: Isaiah 53 - "He was pierced for our transgressions"
      - From Isaiah's perspective: PROPHETIC FUTURE (yet to come)
      - From Christian perspective: HISTORIC PAST (fulfilled in Jesus)
      - Hebrew: Past tense (prophetic perfect)
      - Translation options:
        a) Future (maintains original prophetic stance)
        b) Past (emphasizes Christian fulfillment)
        c) Timeless (eternal significance)

      None of these choices changes the FACT of fulfillment, but affects
      reader's engagement with the text.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: context-dependent  # Depends on translation philosophy
      acceptable_alternatives: [prophetic-future, fulfilled-past, timeless-significance]
      forbidden_values: []  # No forbidden values
      theological_basis: 'Messianic prophecy fulfillment is core doctrine, but temporal framing is a translation choice. Jesus fulfilled prophecy regardless of how temporal distance is marked.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - OPTION 1 (ORIGINAL PERSPECTIVE): Future - maintains prophetic voice
        - OPTION 2 (FULFILLMENT PERSPECTIVE): Past - emphasizes Christian reading
        - OPTION 3 (ETERNAL PERSPECTIVE): Timeless - ongoing theological significance
        - DENOMINATIONAL FACTORS: Some traditions prefer original voice, others Christian reading
        - NOT HERETICAL: Any choice that maintains prophecy-fulfillment truth
        - STUDY BIBLES: May use footnotes to show both perspectives
        - LITURGICAL USE: May prefer timeless for contemporary application

      - interpretation: 'Prophecy is merely historical, not supernatural'
        used_by: [Liberal Christianity, Historical-Critical skeptics]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (denies supernatural prophecy, core to orthodox faith)

# SECTION 2: ARBITRARY (Stylistic/Contextual - The Vast Majority)
arbitrary_contexts:
  - pattern: "Creation narratives (Genesis 1-11)"
    rationale: |
      Whether we mark creation as "remote past" vs "historic past" vs "legendary past"
      is entirely dependent on target language's temporal system. The DOCTRINE is that
      God created - the temporal distance is not doctrinally significant.

      Languages with 5-way systems (Yagua) may use "legendary past" for creation.
      Languages with 2-way systems may use "remote past."
      Both are acceptable - neither changes creation doctrine.
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Patriarchal narratives (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph)"
    rationale: |
      These events occurred thousands of years ago. Whether marked as "historic past"
      or "remote past" or "pre-hesternal" depends entirely on language system.
      Doctrine: God called Abraham, made covenant. Time distance: arbitrary.
    estimated_percentage: 10%

  - pattern: "Exodus and wilderness narratives"
    rationale: |
      Ancient events (~3400 years ago). Time distance marking is arbitrary.
      Doctrine: God delivered Israel from Egypt. Distance: not doctrinally relevant.
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Conquest and Judges period"
    rationale: |
      Ancient Israelite history. Time marking arbitrary.
      Doctrine: God's faithfulness to Israel. Distance: arbitrary.
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Davidic monarchy and Kings narratives"
    rationale: |
      Ancient history (~3000-2500 years ago). Time marking arbitrary.
      Doctrine: Davidic covenant, messianic line. Distance: arbitrary.
    estimated_percentage: 10%

  - pattern: "Prophetic books (historical narratives within)"
    rationale: |
      Prophets lived 2500-2700 years ago. Marking their historical context
      (when they spoke) is arbitrary. Content may be timeless (see above).
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Gospel narratives (Jesus' ministry)"
    rationale: |
      Events occurred ~2000 years ago. Whether marked "historic past" or "remote past"
      is language-dependent. Doctrine: Jesus lived, died, rose. Distance: arbitrary.

      EXCEPTION: Direct discourse (see above) - character perspective matters for clarity.
    estimated_percentage: 20%

  - pattern: "Acts narratives (early church)"
    rationale: |
      Events ~2000 years ago (AD 30-60s). Time marking arbitrary.
      Doctrine: Church founded, gospel spread. Distance: arbitrary.
    estimated_percentage: 10%

  - pattern: "Epistles (narrative portions and greetings)"
    rationale: |
      Paul's travels, Timothy's situation, etc. - contemporary to recipients (~2000 years
      ago from us). Time marking is arbitrary from modern reader's perspective.

      EXCEPTION: Doctrinal statements should be timeless (see above).
    estimated_percentage: 15%

  - pattern: "Apocalyptic/Revelation (past visions, future events)"
    rationale: |
      John's vision: historic past (AD 90s).
      Future events depicted: depends on eschatological view and target language.
      Time marking is arbitrary - doesn't determine eschatological interpretation.
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Travel narratives and itineraries"
    rationale: |
      "They went from X to Y" - all ancient. Time distance arbitrary.
      Doctrine: not affected by temporal distance.
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Genealogies and chronological notes"
    rationale: |
      "X lived Y years" - all ancient history. Time marking arbitrary.
      Doctrine: historical rootedness, messianic line. Distance: arbitrary.
    estimated_percentage: 3%

  - pattern: "Ordinary dialogue and discourse"
    rationale: |
      Most conversations in Scripture. Time marking follows narrative context.
      Rarely affects doctrine.

      EXCEPTION: When dialogue references recent events (character perspective).
    estimated_percentage: 2%

# SUMMARY
#
# Time granularity is 95%+ ARBITRARY from a theological perspective.
#
# The few non-arbitrary cases are CONTEXTUAL (reader clarity, narrative coherence)
# rather than DOCTRINAL (affecting core Christian beliefs).
#
# KEY PRINCIPLE: The *historicity* of events matters theologically.
# The *temporal distance* of events rarely matters theologically.
#
# TRANSLATION GUIDANCE:
# - Follow target language's temporal system
# - Use TBTA's contextual analysis to choose appropriate granularity
# - Prioritize natural language patterns over theological concerns
# - Reserve theological caution for HISTORICITY, not TEMPORAL DISTANCE
#
# CONTRAST WITH OTHER FEATURES:
# - Number (Gen 1:26 Trinity): THEOLOGICALLY CRITICAL (dual = heresy)
# - Person (Acts 15:25 clusivity): CONTEXTUALLY IMPORTANT (exegetical accuracy)
# - Time Granularity: MOSTLY ARBITRARY (linguistic choice, rarely doctrinal)
#
# CONFIDENCE: HIGH
# - Based on internal knowledge of Scripture {llm-cs45}
# - Marked as (unverified) per instructions
# - Ready for peer review by theologians in Stage 6

# PEER REVIEW QUESTIONS FOR STAGE 6:
#
# 1. Are there any contexts where temporal distance DOES affect core doctrine?
#    (I could not identify any in this analysis)
#
# 2. Is the distinction between "timeless teaching" and "historic narrative"
#    adequately captured? Does this affect any denominational distinctives?
#
# 3. Prophecy-fulfillment: Should translations prioritize original prophetic
#    perspective (future) or Christian fulfillment perspective (past)?
#    Is this a theological question or translation philosophy?
#
# 4. Eschatology: Do different temporal framings of Revelation affect
#    premillennial vs amillennial vs postmillennial readings?
#    (I assessed this as arbitrary, but worth peer review)
#
# 5. Are there any liturgical or devotional contexts where temporal framing
#    matters for Christian practice (even if not doctrine)?
#    (e.g., Psalms used in worship - timeless vs historic)

# VALIDATION NOTES:
#
# This analysis is intentionally CONSERVATIVE in labeling things "non-arbitrary."
# When in doubt, I classified as ARBITRARY to avoid false precision.
#
# The theological stakes are consistently LOW-MEDIUM (never HIGH) because
# time granularity fundamentally doesn't affect core doctrines like:
# - Trinity
# - Deity of Christ
# - Atonement
# - Resurrection
# - Salvation by grace
# - Authority of Scripture
#
# Even the "non-arbitrary" cases are about CLARITY and INTERPRETATION,
# not about ORTHODOXY vs HERESY.
#
# This makes time granularity fundamentally different from features like
# NUMBER (where trial vs dual affects Trinitarian doctrine).
