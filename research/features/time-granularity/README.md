# Time Granularity: Stage 1 Research Summary

**Feature**: Time Granularity (Temporal Remoteness / Metrical Tense)
**Research Completed**: 2025-11-29
**Status**: Ready for Stage 2 (Language Study)

## Quick Reference

| Aspect | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| **What it is** | Grammatical encoding of temporal distance from present (how long ago/from now) |
| **TBTA Values** | 20+ values ranging from immediate past to legendary past, plus future and timeless |
| **Source Languages** | NOT encoded in Hebrew or Greek - all values inferential |
| **Global Prevalence** | ~20% of world languages (1000+ languages) |
| **Critical Families** | Bantu (80% have feature), some Amazonian, scattered others |
| **Theological Stakes** | MINIMAL - 95%+ arbitrary; few contextual clarity issues |
| **Translation Impact** | CRITICAL for ~1000 languages; impossible to infer without contextual analysis |

## What is Time Granularity?

**Time granularity** answers: "How far from now did this happen?" or "How precise is the temporal reference?"

Unlike simple tense (past/present/future), time granularity makes fine distinctions:
- **Immediate past**: Just now, today
- **Hesternal**: Yesterday
- **Recent past**: Days or weeks ago
- **Remote past**: Months or years ago, within living memory
- **Historic/Legendary past**: Ancient times, beyond living memory

**Critical distinction**: Time granularity is about DISTANCE, not ASPECT (how action unfolds).

## Core Research Findings

### 1. TBTA Documentation ([TBTA.md](TBTA.md))

**Feature Status**: ✅ Complete in TBTA (Tier A Essential)

**Value Inventory**:
- ~13 values explicitly documented with character codes
- 20+ values claimed in TBTA documentation
- Includes: Present (P), Immediate Past (D), Yesterday (a), Historic Past (i), Timeless (T), Immediate Future (E)

**Critical Finding**: Time granularity is **Position 1 in Verb codes** - only applies to verbs.

**Gateway Feature**: Part of Speech → must be Verb
**No Dependencies**: Orthogonal to Aspect, Mood, Polarity

**Policy**: TBTA prioritizes **semantic/contextual reality** over morphology. Values reflect actual temporal distance of event described, not Greek/Hebrew tense forms.

**Example**: Genesis creation marked as Historic Past (i), regardless of Hebrew verb form, because events are thousands of years old.

**Gap**: Only ~13 of 20+ values have documented character codes. Future granularity largely undocumented.

### 2. Language Typology ([LANGUAGES.md](LANGUAGES.md))

**Global Distribution**: ~20% of world languages make remoteness distinctions {wals-66}

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Neither Hebrew nor Greek encode time granularity
- Hebrew wayyiqtol = narrative sequence, NOT temporal distance
- Greek aorist = simple past, NOT remoteness
- **All TBTA values are 100% inferential from context**

**Language Families**:

| Family | Status | System | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Bantu** | MANDATORY (80%) | 2-4 past, 0-4 future | Best documented, family-wide feature |
| **Amazonian** | MANDATORY (some) | Up to 5 past | Yagua has richest system (5-way) |
| **Austronesian** | VARIABLE | 0-2 | Mixed; Tagalog aspect-based, Hawaiian tenseless |
| **Indo-European** | ABSENT (mostly) | 0 | Rare exceptions (Balochi) |
| **Sino-Tibetan** | ABSENT | 0 | Tenseless systems |
| **Afro-Asiatic** | ABSENT | 0 | Includes Hebrew, Arabic |

**Universal Pattern**: Primary division is almost always **hodiernal** (today) vs. **pre-hodiernal** (before today).

**Asymmetry**: Languages make MORE past distinctions than future (past is known, future uncertain).

**Recommended Test Languages** (for Stage 4):
1. **Yagua** (yad) - 5 past (maximum complexity)
2. **ChiBemba** (bem) - 4 past + 4 future (symmetric)
3. **Swahili** (swh) - 2-3 past (major translation language)
4. **Tagalog** (tgl) - Variable (aspect-based edge case)
5. **English, Spanish, Mandarin** - Controls (absent)

### 3. Scholarly Research ([SCHOLARLY.md](SCHOLARLY.md))

**25+ sources reviewed**, including:

**Foundational Works**:
- Comrie (1985) _Tense_ - Defines tense as "grammaticalization of location in time"
- Dahl (1985) _Tense and Aspect Systems_ - Establishes hodiernal/hesternal/pre-hodiernal terminology
- Nurse (2008) _Tense and Aspect in Bantu_ - Database of 210 Bantu languages, 80% have feature

**Critical Edge Case**:
- Payne & Payne (1990) on Yagua: Documents 5 past tenses (immediate, hesternal, week-month, months-years, legendary)
- Only 2 languages worldwide with 4+ distinctions (Yagua, Chakobo)

**Biblical Language Insight**:
- Hebrew wayyiqtol = "narrative engine," NOT temporal distance marker
- Greek aorist = "snapshot" of action, NOT remoteness (Stagg 1972: "The Abused Aorist")
- Discourse analysis: Genre (narrative vs. teaching) determines time reference more than morphology

**Translation Case Studies**:

**Yagua (5-way system)**:
- Genesis 1:1 → MUST use legendary past (value 5) or be semantically incoherent
- Acts 1:1 → Mid-distance past (value 3-4) for Luke's recent work
- Matthew 5:3 → Timeless for teaching content (not past)

**ChiBemba (4+4 symmetric)**:
- Rigid boundaries - using P0 (today) for yesterday = ungrammatical
- Tests TBTA's future granularity annotations (less common cross-linguistically)

**Tagalog (aspect-based)**:
- No tenses, only aspects (perfective, imperfective, contemplated)
- Time distance through adverbs, not verb morphology
- TBTA's listing as "requiring time granularity" may be overstated

**Key Theoretical Insight**: Graded tense has compositional semantics (Mucha 2012 on Gĩkũyũ) - not arbitrary labels but systematic quantification over times.

### 4. Theological Significance ([THEOLOGICALLY-SIGNIFICANT-GROUPS.yaml](THEOLOGICALLY-SIGNIFICANT-GROUPS.yaml))

**Default Classification**: ARBITRARY (95%+ of contexts)

**Theological Stakes**: MINIMAL - time granularity rarely affects core doctrine

**Key Principle**: **HISTORICITY matters theologically, TEMPORAL DISTANCE does not.**
- Doctrine: God created (Genesis 1) → critical
- Distance: "Remote past" vs "Legendary past" → arbitrary

**Non-Arbitrary Contexts** (CONTEXTUAL, not DOCTRINAL):

1. **Timeless Teaching vs Historical Narrative**
   - Sermon on Mount: Teaching content = TIMELESS, narrative frame = HISTORIC PAST
   - Affects application (eternal vs culturally bound) but not core doctrine
   - Stakes: MEDIUM

2. **Character Perspective in Discourse**
   - Joseph's brothers: "Yesterday we..." = RECENT from their view, HISTORIC from ours
   - Use character's temporal perspective for clarity
   - Stakes: LOW

3. **Prophecy Fulfillment**
   - Isaiah 53: FUTURE from Isaiah, HISTORIC from Christians, or TIMELESS
   - Translation philosophy choice, not doctrinal determinant
   - Stakes: MEDIUM

4. **Eschatological Prophecy**
   - Revelation: Past visions, future events (or fulfilled?)
   - Doesn't determine eschatological interpretation
   - Stakes: LOW-MEDIUM

**Forbidden Values**: NONE - no time granularity choice is heretical

**Contrast with Other Features**:
- **Number** (Gen 1:26): Dual = HERETICAL (denies Trinity), Trial = CORRECT → HIGH stakes
- **Time Granularity**: All choices acceptable, clarity varies → LOW stakes

## Research Discrepancies

### TBTA vs Linguistic Literature

**Discrepancy 1: Tagalog**
- **TBTA claims**: Tagalog requires time granularity
- **Linguistic research**: Tagalog is aspect-based (no tenses), time via adverbs
- **Resolution**: TBTA may mean "adverbial time framing needed," not grammatical tense
- **Implication**: Algorithm should account for aspectual + adverbial strategies, not just tense

**Discrepancy 2: Value Count**
- **TBTA claims**: "20+ values"
- **Documentation shows**: ~13 values with explicit character codes
- **Resolution**: Complete inventory needs extraction from actual TBTA data exports
- **Implication**: Stage 2 must include data mining to find all 20+ values

**Discrepancy 3: Future Granularity**
- **TBTA claims**: Symmetric system with future distinctions
- **Typology shows**: Future remoteness less common than past
- **Documentation**: Only 1 future value (E = Immediate Future) explicitly coded
- **Resolution**: Future system may be less articulated than past
- **Implication**: Don't assume symmetric past/future in algorithm

## Key Insights for Algorithm Development

### Challenge: Total Inference Required

**Neither Hebrew nor Greek encode time granularity** → ALL values must be inferred from:
1. **Narrative framing** (Genesis = ancient, Gospels = historic, epistles = contemporary to recipients)
2. **Discourse genre** (narrative = time-bound, teaching = timeless, prophecy = future)
3. **Temporal adverbs** (when present: "today," "yesterday," "in those days")
4. **Cultural knowledge** (creation, exodus, Jesus' ministry = known timeframes)
5. **Discourse level** (narrator voice vs character speech)

### Default Heuristic

**Most biblical narrative** = Historic Past (beyond living memory)

Override ONLY when:
- Genre = teaching → timeless
- Direct discourse = character's perspective (may be immediate/recent in their time)
- Explicit temporal adverb forces different value

### Contextual Clues Ranking

1. **Discourse genre** (strongest predictor)
2. **Narrative setting** (Genesis vs Gospels vs Epistles)
3. **Temporal adverbs** (explicit but rare)
4. **Discourse level** (narrator vs character)
5. **Verb aspect** (completive vs ongoing vs gnomic)

### Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Flashbacks**: Time relative to narrative baseline or to characters?
2. **Embedded speech**: Character's "yesterday" = recent to them, historic to us
3. **Prophecy**: Original perspective (future) or fulfillment (past)?
4. **Timeless in narrative**: "God is good" (statement) vs "God created" (event)
5. **Epistles**: Doctrinal (timeless) vs greetings/travel (contemporary to recipients)

## Next Steps for Stage 2

### Language Selection Finalized

Must confirm Bible translation coverage for:
1. Yagua (5-way) - **Critical maximum complexity test**
2. ChiBemba (4+4) - **Symmetric system test**
3. Swahili (2-3) - **Common pattern + major translation language**
4. Tagalog (aspect) - **Edge case (non-tense system)**
5. Controls (0) - **English, Spanish, Mandarin for baseline**

### Data Mining Required

1. Extract complete TBTA time granularity inventory from https://github.com/AllTheWord/tbta_db_export
2. Map all 20+ values to character codes
3. Analyze frequency distribution (which values are common vs rare?)
4. Identify future granularity values (under-documented currently)

### Translation Database Design

**Minimum sample size**: 100 verses per value (statistical power)

**Sampling strategy**:
- OT/NT proportional
- Multiple genres (narrative, teaching, prophecy, epistles)
- Mix of typical and adversarial cases
- Direct discourse + narrator voice
- Temporal adverbs present and absent

**Output format**:
- **Answer sheets**: TBTA annotations (for training/validation)
- **Question sheets**: Raw translations (for discovery analysis)

### Feature Interactions to Explore

1. **Time × Genre**: Narrative vs teaching vs prophecy
2. **Time × Discourse Level**: Narrator vs character speech
3. **Time × Aspect**: How do completive/gnomic aspects interact with time?
4. **Time × Adverbs**: When explicit temporal markers override narrative defaults
