# Scholarly Research: Time Granularity

**Feature**: Time Granularity (Temporal Remoteness / Metrical Tense)
**Research Date**: 2025-11-29
**Sources**: 25+ scholarly and typological databases

## Executive Summary

Time granularity, also known as **temporal remoteness** or **metrical/graded tense**, refers to grammatical systems that encode the distance between the time of speaking and the time of an event. Approximately **20% of world languages** make these distinctions, with systems ranging from 2-way (today vs. before-today) to 5-way (Yagua's fine-grained past system).

**Theological Challenge for Bible Translation**: Neither Hebrew nor Greek grammatically encode temporal distance, yet biblical texts describe events spanning from creation (ancient past) to prophecy (future) to timeless principles. Translators into languages requiring time granularity must infer temporal distance from narrative context, discourse genre, and cultural knowledge - exactly what TBTA aims to provide.

**Key Insight**: The primary division across languages is almost universal: **hodiernal** (today) vs. **pre-hodiernal** (before today). Languages with richer systems subdivide the pre-hodiernal further (yesterday, last week, remote, legendary).

### Comrie, Bernard (1985). _Tense_

**Publisher**: Cambridge University Press
**Citation Code**: {comrie-1985-tense}
**URL**: [Tense - Bernard Comrie - Google Books](https://books.google.com/books/about/Tense.html?id=KmFMW40zyFcC)

**Key Findings**:
- Defines tense as "grammaticalization of location in time"
- Distinguishes tense from aspect (internal temporal constituency)
- Notes the "complete neglect of cross-linguistically widespread phenomena like degrees of remoteness in past and future time"
- Establishes theoretical framework for temporal remoteness as legitimate grammatical category

**Relevance**: Foundational definition showing time granularity is a systematic, cross-linguistic phenomenon deserving theoretical attention. Validates TBTA's inclusion of 20+ temporal categories.

**Reference**: [Interview with Dr. Bernard Comrie: tense, aspect and mood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344842411_Interview_with_Dr_Bernard_Comrie_tense_aspect_and_mood)

### Comrie, Bernard (1976). _Aspect_

**Publisher**: Cambridge University Press
**Citation Code**: {comrie-1976-aspect}

**Key Findings**:
- Establishes systematic distinction between tense (time location) and aspect (internal structure)
- Shows aspect is independent of tense
- Provides framework for analyzing perfective/imperfective systems

**Relevance**: Critical for understanding that time granularity is orthogonal to aspect - both can be marked simultaneously. Biblical Hebrew and Greek have rich aspect systems but NO time granularity.

**URL**: [Tense and Aspect Systems - PDF](https://www.su.se/polopoly_fs/1.251617.1444651289!/menu/standard/file/Tense&aspectsystems.pdf)

**Key Findings**:
- Typological survey of tense-aspect systems across world languages
- Identifies standard categories: HODIERNAL (today past), HESTERNAL (yesterday), PRE-HODIERNAL (before yesterday)
- Establishes terminology still used in linguistic typology
- Shows systematicity of remoteness distinctions

**Relevance**: Provides standard terminology TBTA should align with: hodiernal/hesternal/pre-hodiernal framework matches TBTA's D/A/a/b/c distinctions.

### Dahl, Östen (ed.) (2000). _Tense and Aspect in the Languages of Europe_

**Publisher**: Mouton de Gruyter (EUROTYP 20-6)
**Citation Code**: {dahl-2000-europe}

**Key Findings**:
- Comprehensive survey of European tense-aspect systems
- Shows Indo-European generally lacks time granularity (key exception: Balochi)
- Establishes baseline that most European languages do NOT make remoteness distinctions

**Relevance**: Explains why Greek lacks time granularity - typical Indo-European pattern. Important for understanding translation challenge: source languages (Hebrew, Greek) to target languages (Bantu, Amazonian).

**Publisher**: Oxford University Press
**Citation Code**: {nurse-2008-bantu}
**URL**: [Derek Nurse 2008. Tense and Aspect in Bantu - PhilPapers](https://philpapers.org/rec/NURTAA)

**Key Findings**:
- Database of 210 Bantu languages surveyed for tense-aspect
- **80% have more than one past tense** (remoteness distinctions)
- **50% have only one future tense** (asymmetry: more past than future)
- **70%+ have 2-3 past tenses** (most common pattern)
- **10 languages have 4 past tenses** (rare but documented)
- Some Congo varieties claim 5 past tenses (controversial)
- Categories: P1 Hodiernal, P2 Hesternal, P3 Remote

**Relevance**: CRITICAL SOURCE. Bantu is the largest and best-documented family with systematic time granularity. Establishes that this is a major, family-wide feature affecting translation into hundreds of African languages. ChiBemba example directly cited by TBTA.

**Citation Code**: {payne-payne-1990-yagua}
**URL**: [WALS Reference](https://wals.info/refdb/record/Payne-and-Payne-1990)

**Key Findings**:
- Yagua (Peba-Yaguan, Peru) has **5 degrees of past remoteness**
- Categories (pp. 386-388):
  1. A few hours ago (immediate past)
  2. One day ago (hesternal)
  3. Roughly 1 week to 1 month ago
  4. Roughly 1-2 months up to 1-2 years ago
  5. Distant/legendary past
- Richest system in WALS sample
- Only 2 languages worldwide with 4+ distinctions (Yagua and Chakobo)

**Relevance**: CRITICAL EDGE CASE. Shows maximum complexity of time granularity systems. If TBTA's algorithm can handle Yagua's 5-way system, it can handle anything. Important for validating TBTA's "20+ values" claim.

### WALS Feature 66A: The Past Tense

**Source**: World Atlas of Language Structures Online
**Editors**: Dryer, Matthew S. & Haspelmath, Martin (eds.)
**Citation Code**: {wals-feat-66a}
**URL**: [WALS Online - Feature 66A](https://wals.info/feature/66A), [WALS Chapter 66](https://wals.info/chapter/66)

**Classification System**:

| Category | Percentage | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| No past tense | ~40% | Tenseless languages (aspect-only) |
| Present + no remoteness | ~40% | Simple past/non-past distinction |
| Present + 2-3 remoteness | ~17% | Graded tense with few distinctions |
| Present + 4+ remoteness | ~3% | Rich graded tense (rare) |

**Key Findings**:
- **~20% of world languages** make remoteness distinctions (combined 2-3 and 4+ categories)
- Primary division is almost universal: TODAY vs. BEFORE TODAY (hodiernal boundary)
- Languages with remoteness commonly make more distinctions in past than future
- Bantu family is overrepresented in remoteness-marking languages

**Example Languages**:
- **Yagua**: 5 past tenses (richest in sample)
- **Kala Lagaw Ya** (Australian): 8 temporal remoteness distinctions
- **Hawaiian, Mandarin, Yoruba**: No past tense (tenseless)

**Relevance**: Authoritative typological data showing time granularity is significant minority feature (20%) but affects 1000+ languages. Validates TBTA's prioritization as Tier A Essential feature.

**Reference**: [WALS Online - Chapter The Past Tense](https://wals.info/chapter/66)

### WALS Chapter S7: Tense and Aspect

**Citation Code**: {wals-s7-tense-aspect}
**URL**: [WALS Online - Tense and Aspect](https://wals.info/chapter/s7)

**Key Findings**:
- Survey draws on Dahl (1985) and Bybee et al. (1994)
- Tense = "grammaticalization of location in time" (Comrie 1985:6)
- Aspect = "grammaticalization of expression of internal temporal constituency" (Comrie 1985:6)
- Tense and aspect not always separate categories - can be fused

**Relevance**: Provides cross-linguistic baseline for understanding how tense/aspect interact. Shows time granularity is subdivision of tense, not aspect.

**Source**: Grambank - Grammar Database
**Citation Code**: {grambank-gb309}
**URL**: [Grambank GB309](https://grambank.clld.org/parameters/GB309)

**Question**: "Are there multiple past or multiple future tenses, distinguishing distance from Time of Reference?"

**Key Findings**:
- Confirms WALS findings with additional language data
- Shows systematic geographic clustering (Bantu Africa, parts of Amazonia, scattered elsewhere)
- Future remoteness less common than past remoteness

**Relevance**: Independent confirmation of WALS typology from different research project.

### Mucha, Anne (2012). "Beyond the past, present, and future: towards the semantics of 'graded tense' in Gĩkũyũ"

**Journal**: _Natural Language Semantics_ 21(3)
**Citation Code**: {mucha-2012-gikuyu}
**URL**: [Springer Article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11050-012-9092-3)

**Language**: Gĩkũyũ (Kikuyu, Northeastern Bantu, Kenya)

**Key Findings**:
- Gĩkũyũ has **4 grades of past tense** and **3 grades of future tense**
- Graded tense morphology tracks how far into past/future an event occurs
- Proposes semantic analysis: tenses are **quantificational** (work like quantifiers over times)
- "Graded tense" is systematic semantic phenomenon, not ad hoc list

**Relevance**: CRITICAL THEORETICAL INSIGHT. Shows time granularity has compositional semantics - not just arbitrary labels. Supports TBTA's fine-grained distinctions as linguistically motivated. Provides semantic framework for algorithm development.

### Riegg, Magdalena (2020). _Tense and Aspect in Pangwa_

**Publisher**: University of Regensburg
**Citation Code**: {riegg-2020-pangwa}
**URL**: [PDF](https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/51126/1/RPiL_21.pdf)

**Language**: Pangwa (Bantu, Tanzania)

**Key Findings**:
- Detailed analysis of Bantu tense-aspect system in Morogoro region
- Examines interaction of tense, aspect, and remoteness
- Shows regional variation within Bantu family

**Relevance**: Case study showing micro-variation even within Bantu. Algorithm must account for language-specific details, not assume all Bantu languages identical.

### Givón, Talmy (1972). "Studies in ChiBemba and Bantu grammar"

**Journal**: _Studies in African Linguistics_ 3(3): 1-248
**Citation Code**: {givon-1972-chibemba}

**Language**: ChiBemba (Bemba, Zambia)

**Key Findings**:
- ChiBemba (IciBemba) has tenses "numbering into double figures"
- Symmetric system: 4 past + 4 future (plus present)
- Distinguishes hodiernal/hesternal/pre-hesternal
- One of few Bantu languages with symmetric past/future

**Relevance**: TBTA directly cites ChiBemba as example language. Foundational description of symmetric remoteness system. Important test case for algorithm.

### Kroeger, Paul (2018). "Temporal Remoteness markers (metrical tense)"

**In**: _Analyzing Meaning: An Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics_ (21.5)
**Publisher**: Social Sci LibreTexts
**Citation Code**: {kroeger-2018-remoteness}
**URL**: [LibreTexts Chapter 21.5](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Anthropology/Linguistics/Book:_Analyzing_Meaning_-_An_Introduction_to_Semantics_and_Pragmatics_(Kroeger)/21:_Tense/21.05:_Temporal_Remoteness_markers_(metrical_tense))

**Key Findings**:
- "Metrical tense" = alternative term for temporal remoteness
- Remoteness is "measurement of distance between two points or intervals in time"
- Present moment typically serves as reference point
- Frequent use of hodiernal/hesternal terminology based on Latin

**Example: Yimas (Ramu-Lower Sepik, PNG)**:
- Distinguishes: earlier today, yesterday, ~2-5 days ago, before ~5 days ago
- May use irrealis mood for legendary/highly remote past

**Relevance**: Provides accessible textbook treatment with clear definitions. Shows PNG languages (not just Bantu/Amazonian) have time granularity. "Metrical tense" terminology useful for literature search.

### Toosarvandani, Maziar (2025). "Languages Without Tense"

**Journal**: _Language and Linguistics Compass_
**Citation Code**: {toosarvandani-2025-tenseless}
**URL**: [Wiley Online](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/lnc3.70017)

**Key Findings**:
- ~40% of world languages are tenseless (no past/non-past grammatical distinction)
- Tenseless languages use aspect, adverbs, and context for time reference
- Examples: Mandarin, Hawaiian, Yoruba, Guarani, many Mayan languages
- **Critical**: Time granularity is ABSENT in tenseless languages (can't subdivide what doesn't exist)

**Relevance**: Establishes baseline: languages without tense have NO time granularity. Important for classification and translation database selection (need tenseless controls).

## 5. Biblical Language Studies

### Hebrew Verbal System

**Citation Code**: {llm-cs45} (from general knowledge)

#### Wayyiqtol in Narrative

**Sources**:
- [Understanding Wayyiqtol in Biblical Hebrew](https://biblicalhebrew.org/understanding-wayyiqtol-in-biblical-hebrew.aspx)
- [The Hebrew Verbal System: Wayyiqtol Forms](https://biblicalhebrew.org/hebrew-verbal-system-wayyiqtol-forms-in-biblical-narrative.aspx)

**Key Findings**:
- **Wayyiqtol** (וַיִּקְטֹל) = consecutive preterite, narrative past tense
- Formed by: waw consecutive (וַ) + yiqtol (imperfect)
- **Function**: "Narrative engine" of Hebrew Bible - advances plot step-by-step
- Used for sequential past actions in narrative (Genesis, Exodus, Samuel, Kings)
- Does NOT encode temporal distance - just narrative sequence

**Example**: Genesis 1:3 - וַיֹּאמֶר ... וַיְהִי ("And [God] said... and [there] was")
- Wayyiqtol marks narrative progression, NOT how long ago

**Relevance**: CRITICAL FOR TBTA ALGORITHM. Hebrew narrative tense (wayyiqtol) gives NO information about temporal distance. All TBTA time granularity values for OT must be inferred from:
- Narrative framing (Genesis = ancient)
- Historical knowledge (creation, exodus, monarchy)
- Context clues (temporal adverbs when present)

#### Hebrew Tense Debate

**Source**: [The tense category of Biblical Hebrew verbs and ways of its translation](https://www.academia.edu/27832664/The_tense_category_of_Biblical_Hebrew_verbs_and_ways_of_its_translation)

**Key Findings**:
- Scholars disagree on Hebrew verbal system: tense? aspect? modality? taxis?
- Only two "tenses": past and future (qatal vs. yiqtol)
- Translation of Hebrew tense "is an interpretation" - not mechanical decoding

**Relevance**: Confirms inferential nature of TBTA time annotations for Hebrew texts.

### Greek Aorist Tense

**Sources**:
- [The Aorist is so much more than a past tense - Bill Mounce](https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/the-aorist-so-much-more-past-tense)
- [Aorist - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorist)
- Frank Stagg (1972). "The Abused Aorist." _Journal of Biblical Literature_

**Key Findings**:
- **Aorist** (ἀόριστος) = "indefinite" - unmarked/default verb form
- Describes action as **whole, complete event** ("snapshot")
- **Primary function**: Narrative - "what happened next?"
- **Does NOT encode temporal distance**: aorist can represent immediate, recent, remote, or historic past
- Context determines time distance, NOT morphology

**Example**: Gospel aorists describe events ~2000 years ago, but morphology is identical to aorists for recent past

**Stagg's Warning**: "The fallacy of 'theology in the aorist tense' stubbornly persists" - don't over-interpret aorist

**Translation Challenge**: Greek aorist → Western languages lost aorist → difficulties in NT translation

**Relevance**: CRITICAL. Like Hebrew wayyiqtol, Greek aorist gives NO temporal distance information. TBTA must infer from context:
- Gospel narratives = historic past (~2000 years)
- Epistles = contemporary (writer's present)
- Parables/teachings = timeless

**Important**: Campbell (2007) suggests pluperfect encodes "heightened remoteness" - but aorist does NOT

### Discourse Analysis for Bible Translation

**Source**: [Discourse Analysis and Bible Translation - De Gruyter](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/opth-2016-0042/html?lang=en)

**Key Findings**:
- Discourse analysis helps move beyond formal vs. dynamic equivalence
- Greek narrative: aorist carries mainline (backbone), imperfect for background
- Foreground/background distinction universal in narrative
- Tense-forms indicate discourse structure, not just time

**Example**: Acts 16:16-40 narrative structure analysis

**Relevance**: Time granularity interacts with discourse structure. TBTA must distinguish:
- Mainline narrative events (foregrounded) vs. background
- Teaching discourse (timeless) vs. historical narrative (time-bound)
- Direct speech (character's temporal perspective) vs. narrator's voice

## 6. Translation Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Tagalog (Austronesian, Philippines)

**Language**: Tagalog (tgl)
**Family**: Austronesian
**Time Granularity Status**: Optional/Variable (aspect-based system)

**Sources**:
- [Tagalog grammar - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog_grammar)
- [Time reference in Tagalog: Verbal aspect and morphological complexity](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/time-reference-in-tagalog-verbal-aspect-and-morphological-complex)
- [Verbal Aspect vs Tense in Tagalog](https://www.filipitaly.com/2020/11/verbal-aspect-vs-tense-in-tagalog.html)

**Key Features**:
- **No tenses** - only **verbal aspect** (not tense)
- Three aspects:
  1. **Perfective/Completed** (particle "na" for emphasis on completion)
  2. **Imperfective/Progressive** (reduplication of first syllable)
  3. **Contemplated** (anticipated, not yet started)
- Time reference through: aspect + temporal adverbs + context
- Agglutinative morphology: complex affix system (prefix, infix, suffix, circumfix)

**Specific Verse Challenge**: Genesis creation narratives
- **Without TBTA**: Translator sees Greek aorist, must guess time frame
- **With TBTA**: Marked as "historic past" → use completed aspect with remote time adverbs

**Insight**: TBTA's listing of Tagalog as requiring time granularity may be **overstated** - linguistic literature emphasizes aspect over tense. However, temporal adverbs still needed, and TBTA helps select appropriate framing.

**Translation Strategy**: Use perfective aspect for ancient events + adverbial phrases for remoteness ("noong unang panahon" = "in ancient times")

### Case Study 2: Yagua (Peba-Yaguan, Peru)

**Language**: Yagua (yad)
**Family**: Peba-Yaguan (language isolate or small family)
**Time Granularity Status**: MANDATORY (5-way past system)

**Source**: Payne & Payne (1990) - see Section 1

**System**:
1. Immediate past (few hours ago)
2. Hesternal (yesterday, one day ago)
3. Recent past (1 week to 1 month)
4. Mid-distance past (1-2 months to 1-2 years)
5. Legendary/distant past (ancient, mythological)

**Critical Verses**:

**Genesis 1:1** - "In the beginning, God created..."
- **TBTA marking**: Historic/Legendary Past (value 5)
- **Yagua requirement**: MUST use legendary past tense
- **Why critical**: Using wrong tense (e.g., "last month") would be semantically incoherent
- **Translation**: Choose verb form for legendary/creation time

**Acts 1:1** - "In my former book..." (Luke's intro to Acts)
- **TBTA marking**: Mid-distance past (Luke wrote recently relative to Acts)
- **Yagua requirement**: Choose tense appropriate for recent-but-completed work (value 3 or 4)
- **Why critical**: "Yesterday" too recent, "legendary" too remote
- **Translation**: Requires contextual knowledge of when Luke wrote

**Matthew 5:3** - "Blessed are the poor in spirit" (Sermon on Mount)
- **TBTA marking**: Timeless/Gnomic (teaching, universal principle)
- **Yagua challenge**: Timeless teachings may use present or gnomic aspect, not past tense
- **Why critical**: Mixing narrative (Jesus spoke, historic past) with teaching content (timeless)
- **Translation**: Use present or gnomic for the teaching itself, past for "Jesus said"

**Insight**: Yagua's 5-way system requires EXTREME precision in TBTA annotation. Errors have immediate translation consequences. Algorithm must learn to distinguish:
- Creation/legendary (5)
- Patriarchs/Exodus (5, possibly 4)
- Jesus' ministry (3 or 4, depending on Yagua's baseline)
- Paul's letters - contemporary to recipients (1 or 2 in embedded narratives)

### Case Study 3: ChiBemba (Bantu, Zambia)

**Language**: ChiBemba/Bemba (bem)
**Family**: Bantu (Central)
**Time Granularity Status**: MANDATORY (4 past + 4 future symmetric system)

**Source**: Givón (1972) - see Section 3

**System** (based on Nurse's P1/P2/P3 categories + future):
- **P0**: Hodiernal (today past)
- **P1**: Hesternal (yesterday)
- **P2**: Pre-hesternal (before yesterday)
- **P3**: Remote (weeks/months/years ago)
- **F0**: Hodiernal future (later today)
- **F1**: Crastinal (tomorrow)
- **F2**: Post-crastinal (after tomorrow)
- **F3**: Remote future

**Critical Verses**:

**Genesis 1:1** - Creation
- **TBTA**: Historic past
- **ChiBemba**: P3 (Remote past)
- **Why**: Boundaries are rigid in some Bantu - cannot use P0-P2 for ancient events

**John 1:1** - "In the beginning was the Word"
- **Challenge**: References creation (remote) but also timeless existence
- **ChiBemba decision**: Remote past for narrative framing, but "was" (existence) may be timeless
- **Translation nuance**: Verb choice affects theological interpretation

**Matthew 28:7** - "He is going ahead of you to Galilee"
- **TBTA**: Immediate future
- **ChiBemba**: F0 or F1 (today or tomorrow)
- **Why critical**: Disciples would travel soon (not months later)

**Insight**: ChiBemba's symmetric system tests TBTA's future granularity annotations (less common cross-linguistically). Rigid boundaries mean wrong choice creates ungrammaticality.

**Theological Implication**: Timeless statements about God's nature may resist time marking - ChiBemba translator must decide whether to use present or bypass tense entirely in copular constructions.

## 7. Semantic and Philosophical Perspectives

### Time in Narrative Discourse

**Source**: [Foreground and background in narrative discourse - Luke's Gospel](https://scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2224-33802020000100004)

**Key Findings**:
- Foreground vs. background universal in narrative
- Greek: aorist = mainline/foreground, imperfect = background
- Languages use various devices for this distinction (tense, aspect, particles)

**Relevance**: Time granularity interacts with narrative structure:
- Foregrounded events (plot advancement) vs. background (setting, description)
- Mainline actions may receive different time marking than background
- Algorithm must account for narrative level, not just temporal distance

### Discourse Genre and Temporal Reference

**Source**: TBTA {tbta-translation-edge-cases}

**Key Findings**:
- **Narrative genre**: Time-bound events, historical anchoring
  - Genesis creation → Historic/Legendary Past
  - Gospel events → Historic Past
- **Teaching/Expository genre**: Timeless principles
  - Sermon on Mount → Timeless/Gnomic
  - Proverbs → Timeless
  - Paul's doctrinal statements → Timeless
- **Prophetic genre**: Future (from original perspective), may include timeless
  - Isaiah's prophecies → Future (original) or Historic Past (Christian perspective)

**Relevance**: CRITICAL DISTINCTION. Genre determines appropriate time granularity:
- Narrative → temporal distance matters
- Teaching → use timeless/gnomic
- Mixed (narrative + embedded teaching) → requires careful distinction

**Algorithm Implication**: Must identify discourse genre before assigning time values. Cannot assign "historic past" to Sermon on Mount teachings (timeless), even though Jesus spoke them ~2000 years ago.

### Evidentiality and Time

**Source**: {llm-cs45} (general linguistic knowledge)

**Concept**: Some languages combine temporal remoteness with **evidentiality** (how speaker knows information):
- Direct witness (personal experience)
- Hearsay/reported (told by others)
- Inferred (deduced from evidence)
- Assumed/cultural knowledge

**Relevance for Bible**: Biblical narratives are **transmitted knowledge** (not direct witness by translator). Languages with evidential systems may require:
- Reported/hearsay markers for all biblical events
- Cultural knowledge markers for well-known stories (creation, exodus)
- This may interact with time granularity

**Example**: A language might distinguish:
- Recent past + witnessed
- Recent past + hearsay
- Remote past + cultural knowledge/legendary

**Algorithm Challenge**: TBTA doesn't encode evidentiality (out of scope), but translators into evidential languages need both time AND source of knowledge.

---

## 8. Key Theoretical Questions

### Q1: Is there a universal maximum for time granularity distinctions?

**Evidence**:
- Yagua: 5 past tenses (richest documented)
- Kala Lagaw Ya (Australian): 8 temporal remoteness distinctions (WALS)
- ChiBemba: 4 past + 4 future = 8 total (plus present)

**Answer**: No fixed maximum, but **5 past distinctions** appears to be practical ceiling. Systems with 6+ are extremely rare or controversial.

**Implication for TBTA**: The claimed "20+ values" likely includes:
- Past: 5-10 distinctions
- Future: 3-5 distinctions
- Present: 1
- Timeless/Gnomic: 1
- Discourse-based variations
- Total: Plausibly 15-25 values

### Q2: Why is past remoteness more common than future remoteness?

**Evidence**:
- Nurse (2008): 80% of Bantu have multiple pasts, only 50% have multiple futures
- Cross-linguistic tendency (WALS, Dahl)

**Theories**:
1. **Epistemic**: Past is known, future is uncertain → uncertainty competes with distance
2. **Cognitive**: Memory and distance are more clearly linked than prediction and distance
3. **Discourse**: Narratives (past-oriented) more common than prophecy/planning (future-oriented)

**Relevance**: TBTA likely has more past values than future values. Algorithm should expect:
- Rich past annotation (5-10 values)
- Simpler future annotation (2-3 values)
- Many futures may blend distance with certainty/intention

### Q3: What is the Biblical "default" temporal distance?

**Hypothesis**: For narrative, **Historic Past** (beyond living memory) is default for nearly all biblical events.

**Evidence**:
- OT events: 2000-5000+ years old (creation to post-exilic)
- NT events: ~2000 years old (Jesus' ministry, early church)
- Only exceptions:
  - Direct discourse (characters speaking about recent events in their timeframe)
  - Prophetic future (from original perspective)
  - Timeless teachings

**Implication**: Algorithm should have strong prior for "Historic Past" in biblical narrative, overridden only by:
- Genre (teaching → timeless)
- Embedded speech (character perspective)
- Explicit temporal adverbs ("today", "yesterday" in discourse)

## 10. Summary of Key Insights for Algorithm Development

### Critical Findings

1. **Source language challenge is ABSOLUTE**: Neither Hebrew nor Greek encode time granularity. ALL TBTA values must be inferred from context, narrative framing, genre, and cultural knowledge.

2. **Typological prevalence**: ~20% of world languages (1000+) require time granularity, concentrated in Bantu, some Austronesian, some Amazonian, scattered elsewhere.

3. **Universal pattern**: Primary division at "today" boundary (hodiernal vs. pre-hodiernal) is nearly universal where feature exists.

4. **Asymmetry**: Languages typically make more past than future distinctions (past is known, future uncertain).

5. **Range**: 2-way (minimal) to 5-way (maximal documented past), with 2-3 way most common.

6. **Genre dependency**: Narrative (time-bound) vs. teaching (timeless) is CRITICAL distinction for correct annotation.

7. **Discourse perspective**: Direct speech uses character's temporal perspective, not narrator's (e.g., "today" in Genesis character speech = their present, not our past).

8. **Semantic compositionality**: Graded tense has systematic semantics (Mucha 2012), not arbitrary labels - supports learning-based algorithm.

### Algorithm Priorities

1. **Genre classification first**: Determine narrative vs. teaching vs. prophecy before time assignment
2. **Narrative framing**: Learn from story setting (Genesis = ancient, Gospels = historic, epistles = contemporary to recipients)
3. **Temporal adverbs**: Key contextual clues when present ("today", "yesterday", "in those days")
4. **Discourse level**: Distinguish narrator voice from character speech
5. **Default heuristic**: Most biblical narrative = Historic Past (beyond living memory), override only with specific evidence
