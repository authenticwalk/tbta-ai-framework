# Scholarly Research: Discourse Genre

## Executive Summary

Discourse genre classification is a well-established field in linguistics and biblical studies, with two major frameworks:

1. **Longacre's Functional Taxonomy** (4 main types): Narrative, Procedural, Behavioral/Hortatory, Expository - distinguished by agent focus, temporal succession, and projection
2. **Traditional Biblical Genres** (7-8 types): Law, Narrative, Poetry, Wisdom, Prophecy, Epistles, Apocalyptic - distinguished by literary form and function

**Theological challenges** arise in genre recognition affecting interpretation (e.g., distinguishing literal narrative from apocalyptic symbolism, recognizing legal vs. wisdom genre affects application).

**Cross-linguistic challenges** include: (1) languages lacking certain genre traditions (written legal codes, epistolary forms), (2) genre-specific grammatical marking (narrative tense systems, procedural aspect), (3) discourse markers varying by genre.

**Translation impact**: All languages require genre awareness for appropriate translation strategies, though manifestation differs - some mark genre morphologically (verb forms, particles), others through discourse structure (connectives, participant reference).

## 1. Scholarly Sources

### Longacre, Robert E. (1996). *The Grammar of Discourse*

**Key Findings**:
- Proposes 4-way genre taxonomy based on functional features
- **Narrative**: +agent orientation, +contingent temporal succession (stories, accounts)
- **Procedural**: -agent orientation, +contingent succession (instructions, "how-to")
- **Hortatory/Behavioral**: +agent orientation, -contingent succession (exhortation, advice, commands)
- **Expository**: -agent orientation, -contingent succession (explanation, description, argument)
- Each main type has 2 subtypes (e.g., Narrative: story, future events)

**Citation Code**: {longacre-1996-grammar}

**Relevance**: Provides functional framework for predicting how genre affects grammatical choices across languages. Unlike form-based taxonomies, focuses on communicative purpose.

### Longacre, Robert E. & Hwang, Shin Ja J. (2012). *Holistic Discourse Analysis* (2nd ed.)

**Key Findings**:
- Expands genre framework with detailed analysis of each type
- Expository discourse is "not extremely common in languages" - narrative and hortatory more universal
- Procedural least common across languages
- Provides field manual methodology for discourse analysis in translation contexts
- Last three chapters focus on non-narrative discourses (procedural, hortatory, expository)

**Citation Code**: {longacre-hwang-2012-holistic}

**Relevance**: Directly applicable to Bible translation field contexts. Suggests procedural and expository genres may require special attention in minority languages lacking these traditions.

### Patton, Matthew H., Putnam, Frederic C., & Van Pelt, Miles V. (2019). *Basics of Hebrew Discourse*

**Key Findings**:
- Macro-syntax approach: relationships **between** clauses, not just within clauses
- **Hebrew Narrative Discourse Markers**:
  - Wayyiqtol verb chains signal sequential narrative
  - Weqatal for non-sequential or circumstantial
  - Asyndeton (lack of conjunction) marks new units, time shifts
  - הִנֵּה (hinneh), גַּם (gam), אוּלַי (ulay) as discourse particles
- **Hebrew Poetry Discourse Features**:
  - Parallelism (semantic, grammatical, phonological)
  - Terseness and ellipsis
  - Metaphorical density higher than narrative

**Citation Code**: {patton-putnam-vanpelt-2019-hebrew}

**Relevance**: Identifies specific Hebrew genre markers that must be recognized to correctly label discourse genre in source text. Shows genre affects grammatical form choice (verb sequences differ by genre).

### Ernst R. Wendland (ed., 2020s). *Discourse Analysis of Biblical Hebrew Narratives* (Fontes Press)

**Key Findings**:
- Analysis of each narrative text in Hebrew Bible
- Multiple methodologies: linguistic, cultural, historical approaches
- Macro-analysis of narratives supported by discourse features
- Sequel volume planned for prophetic and poetic literature

**Citation Code**: {wendland-2020-hebrew-narratives}

**Relevance**: Demonstrates variety of discourse analysis methodologies currently employed. Shows genre classification requires multiple levels of analysis (not just surface markers).

### Levinsohn, Stephen H. (1992/2000). *Discourse Features of New Testament Greek*

**Key Findings**:
- Greek particles (δὲ, καί, τέ, γάρ, οὖν) function as discourse connectives
- Traditional Greek grammars inadequately describe particle functions
- Discourse linguistics framework better explains particle distribution
- Particles signal genre-relevant features: topic continuity, backgrounding, highlighting

**Citation Code**: {levinsohn-1992-greek-discourse}

**Relevance**: Shows that source language genre affects particle choice, which in turn affects how we identify genre boundaries and transitions in Greek NT.

### Wendland, Ernst R. & Aubrey, M. G. (eds., 2023). *Discourse Analysis and Bible Translation* (SIL coursebook)

**Key Findings**:
- **Narrative genres**: Connectors, constituent ordering, speech reporting, participant reference systems
- **Behavioral genres**: Exhortation, instruction, linguistic honorifics
- Language-specific sections for verb-initial, verb-medial, verb-final languages
- Backgrounding vs. highlighting devices vary by genre
- Rhetorical questions, conditionals, relative clauses as genre-specific discourse features

**Citation Code**: {wendland-aubrey-2023-discourse-translation}

**Relevance**: Shows discourse genre affects word order, connective choice, participant reference - all language-specific. Translation must preserve genre-appropriate discourse features in target language.

**Source**: [SIL Global](https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/98418)

### Dooley, Robert A. & Levinsohn, Stephen H. *Analyzing Discourse: A Manual of Basic Concepts* (SIL)

**Key Findings**:
- Narrative discourse analysis training materials based on Acts 16:16-40
- Natural ways of starting new sections, joining clauses/sentences
- Describing characters in stories (participant reference)
- Representing speech and thoughts
- Highlighting important information
- Distinguishing main events from background information

**Citation Code**: {dooley-levinsohn-sil-analyzing}

**Relevance**: Provides practical framework for identifying discourse features that vary by genre. Main events vs. background is genre-dependent (narrative foregrounds action, expository foregrounds logic).

**Source**: [SIL Global - Training Materials](https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/69386)

### Hoyle, Michael (SIL). "Scenarios, Discourse, and Translation"

**Key Findings**:
- Fillmore's case frames: scenarios are culture-specific, grammatical markers language-specific
- **Case frame mismatch** creates translation problems
- What is implicit in source language may be grammatically obligatory in target language
- Genre affects which participants must be grammatically marked

**Citation Code**: {hoyle-sil-scenarios}

**Relevance**: Explains why discourse genre matters for translation - different genres have different case frame expectations. Procedural genre foregrounds instruments, narrative foregrounds agents.

**Source**: [SIL](https://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/17/80/79/17807987582008905937674262856095982918/50670_Hoyle_ScenariosDiscourseTranslation.pdf)

### Biblical Genre Recognition Resources (Multiple Authors)

**Key Findings from Core Christianity, GotQuestions.org, American Bible Society**:

- **Standard 7-8 Biblical Genres**: Law, History/Narrative, Poetry, Wisdom, Prophecy, Gospels/Acts, Epistles, Apocalyptic
- **Narrative**: 43% of Bible content (Lubeck), characterized by story arc, characters, events
- **Poetry**: 33% of Bible (Lubeck), parallelism, imagery, emotional depth
- **Discourse** (Epistles, speeches): 24% (Lubeck), logical sequence of ideas
- **Failure to recognize genre** leads to misinterpretation (e.g., treating apocalyptic symbols literally)

**Citation Code**: {core-christianity-genres}, {gotquestions-genres}, {american-bible-society-genres}

**Relevance**: Confirms genre recognition is essential for interpretation. Each genre has different hermeneutical rules - legal texts applied differently than wisdom literature.

**Source**:

- [GotQuestions](https://www.gotquestions.org/Bible-genres.html)
- [American Bible Society](https://bibleresources.americanbible.org/resource/different-kinds-of-literature-in-the-bible)

### Bible Project. "Poetry, Narrative & Prose Discourse"

**Key Findings**:
- **Imagery and metaphor** (poetry) engage right brain - emotional, imaginative
- **Discourse** (epistles, speeches) engages left brain - logical, linear thought
- Discourse purposes: inform, persuade, comfort, challenge, warn
- Epistles combine teaching (expository) + exhortation (hortatory)

**Citation Code**: {bible-project-genres}

**Relevance**: Shows genres appeal to different cognitive processing. Translation must preserve the appropriate cognitive engagement (poetic metaphor vs. logical argument).

**Source**: [Bible Project Podcast](https://bibleproject.com/podcast/how-read-bible-part-4-poetry-narrative-and-prose-discourse-genres/)

### MacSaveny, Tim (DIU). "Towards a Description of Descriptive Discourse"

**Key Findings**:
- Proposes **Descriptive** as 5th major genre type (beyond Longacre's 4)
- Descriptive discourse: static, non-temporal, non-agentive (e.g., describing tabernacle, genealogies)
- Distinct grammatical features: stative verbs, nominal clauses, spatial/relational vocabulary

**Citation Code**: {macsaveny-descriptive}

**Relevance**: Suggests Longacre's 4-way taxonomy may be incomplete. Biblical texts have significant descriptive passages (tabernacle details, genealogies, visions) requiring special handling.

**Source**: [DIU GIAL Lens](https://www.diu.edu/documents/gialens/Vol4-3/Tim-MacSaveny-Description-of-Descriptive-Discourse.pdf)

### Form Criticism: Hermann Gunkel (early 20th century)

**Key Findings**:
- Formgeschichte (form criticism) analyzes oral tradition genre origins
- Sitz im Leben (life setting) determines genre
- Recurring motifs, vocabulary, rhetorical patterns define genre units
- Applied to Psalms (hymn, lament, thanksgiving), prophets (oracle, woe, lawsuit)

**Citation Code**: {gunkel-form-criticism}

**Relevance**: Historical foundation for genre analysis in biblical studies. Shows genres arise from social functions (worship, prophecy, law court) - helps predict cross-linguistic genre patterns.

**Source**: Referenced in [Dallas International University](https://www.diu.edu/diu-today/program-spotlights/current-state-new-testament-discourse-analysis/)

### Reed, Jeffrey T. & Reese, Ruth Anne (SIL). "Checking Translations for Discourse Features"

**Key Findings**:
- Discourse features often invisible to translators in their own language
- Systematic checking needed: paragraph structure, connectives, participant reference, information structure
- Genre affects expected discourse patterns
- Translation consultants must check genre-appropriate features

**Citation Code**: {reed-reese-sil-checking}

**Relevance**: Shows that genre-appropriate discourse features must be explicitly checked in translation. Provides methodology for validation in Stage 6.

**Source**: [SIL](https://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/15/54/51/155451569992791493750509036603970147276/siljot2006_2_03.pdf)

### SIL (1993). *Biblical Hebrew and Discourse Linguistics* - Dallas Seminar

**Key Findings**:
- 22 papers in 3 parts: Grammatical/Syntactical/Accent Studies, Narrative Genre, Non-narrative Genres
- Foundational seminar establishing discourse linguistics approach to Hebrew Bible
- Integration of grammatical form with discourse function

**Citation Code**: {sil-1993-hebrew-discourse-seminar}

**Relevance**: Historical marker showing when discourse linguistics became mainstream in biblical studies. Demonstrates 30+ years of development in this field.

**Source**: [SIL Global](https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/6606)

### Digital Humanities & AI in Genre Analysis (Post-2019)

**Key Findings**:
- Corpus linguistics + machine learning identify genre markers empirically
- Syntactic patterns, lexical frequencies, discourse features distinguish genres
- Formulaic repetitions in legal genres vs. metaphorical density in poetry
- Large language models trained on tagged Hebrew/Greek corpora

**Citation Code**: {digital-humanities-genre-2019}

**Relevance**: Emerging tools for automated genre classification. Suggests Stage 2 analysis could use computational methods to validate genre markers.

## 2. Typological Databases

### WALS (World Atlas of Language Structures)

**Overview**:
- 142 maps covering 2,650 languages
- 58,000+ data points on structural features
- Features include: vowel inventory, noun-genitive order, passive constructions, tense systems

**Relevant Features** (potential correlation with genre):
- **Tense/Aspect systems**: May affect narrative vs. non-narrative marking
- **Word order typology**: May correlate with genre-specific constituent ordering
- **Passive constructions**: Relevant for agent-oriented (narrative, hortatory) vs. patient-oriented (procedural) genres

**Citation Code**: {wals-2013}

**Implication**: Genre marking likely interacts with typological features. Languages with complex tense/aspect may mark genre through verbal morphology; isolating languages through particles/word order.

**Source**: [WALS Online](https://wals.info/), [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/wals-2013)

**Note**: WALS does not have a specific "discourse genre" feature, but related features (tense/aspect, word order, passives) likely correlate with genre marking strategies.

### Grambank (not accessed, future research)

**Note**: Grambank is another major typological database (similar to WALS) with additional grammatical features. Future research should investigate if Grambank includes discourse-related features.

## 3. Translation Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Luqa Language (Austronesian, Solomon Islands)

**Genre Handling**: New Testament translation into Luqa sparked vernacular revival movement
**Specific Challenge**: Austronesian languages often topic-prominent rather than subject-prominent
**Insight**: Genre affects topic-comment structure. Narrative tracks participants as topics; expository tracks concepts as topics.

**Source**: {austronesian-bible-translation}, [Research article reference](https://www.academia.edu/14133949/Language_vitality_through_Bible_translation)

### Case Study 2: Papua New Guinea Languages (Trans-New Guinea, Sepik, etc.)

**Genre Handling**: Switch-reference systems (marking same-subject vs. different-subject) highly relevant for narrative genre
**Specific Challenge**: Narrative requires tracking participant continuity across clauses
**Insight**: Languages with switch-reference mark genre implicitly - narrative has high switch-reference density, expository has low density

**Source**: {png-bible-translation}, referenced in [Wycliffe Associates PNG Advance](https://wycliffeassociates.org/projects/png-advance/)

**Key Verse Example**: Genesis 4:8 - Multiple "he"s require tracking (Cain vs. Abel). Switch-reference languages automatically disambiguate in narrative.

### Case Study 3: Trique Language (Oto-Manguean, Mexico) - Robert Longacre

**Genre Handling**: Robert Longacre translated NT into Trique
**Specific Challenge**: Tone languages may use tone patterns to mark discourse boundaries
**Insight**: Tonal melodies can signal genre transitions (narrative to direct speech, story to exposition)

**Source**: {longacre-trique}, mentioned in [Longacre's biography](https://www.amazon.com/Holistic-Discourse-Analysis-Robert-Longacre/dp/1556712669)

### Case Study 4: Greek to English - Epistolary Genre

**Genre Handling**: Paul's epistles mix expository teaching + hortatory exhortation
**Specific Verse**: Romans (entire book) - alternates between theological exposition (chapters 1-11) and practical hortatory (chapters 12-16)
**Insight**: Genre transitions within a single book require recognizing discourse structure shifts. Expository uses γάρ (for, because) heavily; hortatory uses οὖν (therefore) to pivot.

**Source**: {levinsohn-1992-greek-discourse}

### Case Study 5: Hebrew Narrative to Verb-Final Languages

**Genre Handling**: Hebrew narrative's wayyiqtol sequences assume verb-initial/medial structure
**Specific Challenge**: Japanese, Korean, Turkish (SOV) must restructure narrative flow
**Insight**: Genre-appropriate sequencing differs by word order typology. Verb-final languages use conjunctive particles instead of verb forms to signal narrative sequence.

**Source**: {wendland-aubrey-2023-discourse-translation}

## 4. Verse Analysis: Critical Passages Where Genre Identification Matters

### Genesis 1:1-2:3 - Narrative vs. Poetry Debate

**Genre Significance**:
- If **narrative**: Historical account, sequential creation
- If **poetry**: Theological framework, non-sequential or topical arrangement

**Orthodox Position**: Narrative (historical), though employing elevated style

**Translation Impact**: Verb forms, temporal markers must reflect sequential narrative flow

**Source**: {patton-putnam-vanpelt-2019-hebrew}

### Psalm 23 - Poetry (Lyric)

**Genre Significance**: Metaphorical language ("The LORD is my shepherd")

**Translation Impact**: Cannot be rendered as procedural ("How to shepherd") or narrative ("Once upon a time, the LORD shepherded")

**Source**: {bible-project-genres}

### Exodus 20:1-17 - Legal (Apodictic Law)

**Genre Significance**: Direct commands (Ten Commandments)

**Orthodox Position**: Legal genre - universal, binding commands

**Translation Impact**: Must use imperative/command forms appropriate to legal genre in target language

**Source**: {gotquestions-genres}

### Proverbs 1-9 - Wisdom (Hortatory/Teaching)

**Genre Significance**: Father instructing son - hortatory genre

**Translation Impact**: Requires appropriate honorific/pedagogical register in languages with honorific systems

**Source**: {core-christianity-genres}

### Revelation 1-22 - Apocalyptic

**Genre Significance**: Symbolic imagery, prophetic-visionary genre

**Orthodox Position**: Blend of prophecy and apocalyptic symbolism

**Translation Impact**: Metaphors/symbols must not be literalized or naturalized into plain narrative

**Source**: {gotquestions-genres}, {american-bible-society-genres}

### Acts 16:16-40 - Narrative with Embedded Speech

**Genre Significance**: Outer narrative frame + direct speech (prayer, testimony)

**Translation Impact**: Genre transitions require appropriate quotation marking, speech reporting conventions

**Source**: {dooley-levinsohn-sil-analyzing}

### Romans 1-11 vs. 12-16 - Expository vs. Hortatory

**Genre Significance**:
- Chapters 1-11: **Expository** (theological argument)
- Chapters 12-16: **Hortatory** (ethical exhortation)

**Translation Impact**: Connectives shift - γάρ (for) in exposition, οὖν (therefore) pivoting to hortatory

**Source**: {levinsohn-1992-greek-discourse}

### Matthew 13 - Parable (Narrative Subgenre)

**Genre Significance**: Fictional narrative for teaching purposes

**Translation Impact**: Must signal parable genre so readers don't confuse with historical narrative

**Source**: {core-christianity-genres}

### Leviticus 1-7 - Procedural (Ritual Instructions)

**Genre Significance**: "How to" perform sacrifices - procedural genre

**Translation Impact**: Requires procedural verb forms (imperative sequences, conditional structures)

**Source**: {longacre-1996-grammar}

### Job 3-41 - Poetry (Dialogue/Lament)

**Genre Significance**: Poetic dialogue, not prose narrative

**Translation Impact**: Elevated language, parallelism, metaphor must be preserved; not to be naturalized into plain prose

**Source**: {patton-putnam-vanpelt-2019-hebrew}

## 5. Cross-Linguistic Genre Challenges

### Genre Traditions Missing in Target Cultures

**Challenge**: Some cultures lack certain genres as written traditions
- **Epistolary**: Oral cultures may lack formal letter conventions
- **Legal codes**: Customary law vs. written codes
- **Apocalyptic**: Symbolic-visionary genre unfamiliar

**Solution**: Create genre conventions or borrow from related genres

**Source**: {wendland-aubrey-2023-discourse-translation}

### Genre-Specific Grammatical Marking

**Examples**:
- **Japanese**: Narrative past tense (ta) vs. non-narrative perfective (ta) - same form, different function
- **Swahili**: Narrative tense (ka-) vs. general past (li-)
- **Russian**: Perfective/imperfective aspect distribution differs by genre

**Implication**: Genre must be known to select correct grammatical forms

**Source**: General linguistic knowledge; {longacre-hwang-2012-holistic}

### Discourse Markers Vary by Genre

**Hebrew**:
- **Narrative**: Wayyiqtol sequences
- **Poetry**: Parallelism, asyndeton
- **Legal**: Apodictic (commands) vs. casuistic (if-then)

**Greek**:
- **Narrative**: δὲ for continuity, καί for addition
- **Expository**: γάρ for explanation, ἀλλά for contrast
- **Hortatory**: οὖν for exhortation

**Implication**: Source language genre markers must be recognized to map to appropriate target language markers

**Source**: {patton-putnam-vanpelt-2019-hebrew}, {levinsohn-1992-greek-discourse}
