      - Biblical inerrancy (historical vs. theological truth)
      - Hermeneutics (literal vs. literary)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Genre determines interpretation method:
      - NARRATIVE: Sequential, historical, literal 6 days
      - POETRY: Framework, theological, non-sequential arrangement
      Misidentification affects entire creation theology framework.

      preferred_value: narrative  # Majority conservative Protestant view
      acceptable_alternatives: [narrative-with-elevated-style]
      forbidden_values: [mythology, legend]  # Rejected by Christian orthodoxy
      theological_basis: |
        Conservative Protestant orthodoxy affirms Genesis 1-2 as historical narrative
        (though elevated/liturgical style acknowledged). Framework hypothesis (poetic
        interpretation) is minority view within orthodoxy.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Treat as NARRATIVE (historical account, sequential)
        - Recognize elevated/liturgical style but maintain narrative features
        - FORBIDDEN: Treat as myth, legend, or purely symbolic poetry
        - DENOMINATIONAL VARIATION: Framework hypothesis accepted by some Reformed traditions

      - Christology (symbolic vs. literal descriptions of Christ)
      - Hermeneutics (literal vs. symbolic)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Genre determines interpretation method:
      - APOCALYPTIC: Symbolic imagery, numbers, visions require symbolic interpretation
      - LITERAL NARRATIVE: Would lead to bizarre literalization (seven-headed beasts, etc.)
      Misidentification leads to cultic or heretical eschatology.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: apocalyptic-prophecy
      acceptable_alternatives: [prophetic-visionary]
      forbidden_values: [plain-narrative, allegory-only]
      theological_basis: |
        Apocalyptic is a recognized biblical genre using symbolic imagery for theological truth.
        NOT allegory (arbitrary symbols) but apocalyptic (culturally-coded symbols from
        Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah). Requires recognizing genre to interpret correctly.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as APOCALYPTIC or PROPHETIC-VISIONARY
        - Preserve symbolic imagery, do not over-literalize
        - Recognize OT allusions and apocalyptic conventions (numbers, beasts, colors)
        - AVOID: Treating as plain historical narrative or arbitrary allegory
        - DENOMINATIONAL VARIATION: Premillennial, amillennial, postmillennial
          interpretations differ but all recognize apocalyptic genre

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:

  - verse_pattern: 'Parables of Jesus (Matthew 13, Luke 15, etc.) - Parable vs. historical narrative (unverified)'
    affected_values: [parable, narrative]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Hermeneutics (parabolic truth vs. historical event)
      - Christology (Jesus as teacher using parables)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Genre determines truth claims:
      - PARABLE: Fictional narrative for teaching, theological truth not historical event
      - HISTORICAL NARRATIVE: Actual events Jesus witnessed/reported
      Confusing parable with history leads to false historical claims (e.g., claiming
      literal Good Samaritan existed).

    christian_orthodox_position:

      acceptable_alternatives: [teaching-narrative, wisdom-story]
      forbidden_values: [historical-report, mythology]
      theological_basis: |
        Jesus explicitly used parables (Greek παραβολή) - fictional narratives for
        teaching. Gospels label them as parables. Not historical events.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as PARABLE (teaching story, not historical)
        - Preserve signals: "He spoke to them in parables", "The kingdom is like..."
        - AVOID: Treating as historical narrative (falsely claiming events happened)
        - NOTE: Some parables may reference real types (Pharisee, tax collector) without
          being about specific individuals

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Parables are coded allegory requiring secret knowledge'
        used_by: [Gnostic interpretations]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (Jesus explained parables to disciples plainly)

      - Worship theology (psalms as sung worship)
      - Hermeneutics (poetic vs. prosaic interpretation)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Genre affects interpretation and use:
      - POETRY: Parallelism, metaphor, hyperbole expected, emotional/imaginative
      - NARRATIVE: Sequential events, literal expectations
      Treating poetry as prose leads to over-literalization of metaphors
      (e.g., "God has wings" from Psalm 91).

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: poetry-hymnic  # Most psalms are hymnic/liturgical poetry
      acceptable_alternatives: [poetry-lament, poetry-wisdom, poetry-royal]
      forbidden_values: [prose-narrative, mythology]
      theological_basis: |
        Psalms are poetic, liturgical, meant for sung worship. Hebrew parallelism,
        metaphor, and imagery are genre features, not literal descriptions.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as POETRY (hymnic, lament, wisdom, etc.)
        - Preserve parallelism where possible
        - Recognize metaphorical language (God's "wings", "right hand", etc.)
        - AVOID: Treating metaphors as literal physical descriptions
        - NOTE: Some psalms have historical superscriptions (narrative context) but
          psalm itself is poetry

      - Providence (how God works in the world)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Genre determines truth claims:
      - WISDOM: General principles, "this is usually true", practical guidance
      - LEGAL/PROPHECY: Absolute commands or promises, "this is always true"
      Treating wisdom as legal/prophetic leads to "prosperity gospel" errors
      (e.g., Proverbs 22:6 "train up a child" as absolute guarantee).

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: wisdom-instructional
      acceptable_alternatives: [wisdom-proverbial]
      forbidden_values: [legal-absolute, prophetic-promise]
      theological_basis: |
        Proverbs are wisdom literature - general principles for wise living,
        not absolute promises. "Train up a child..." is general principle,
        not guarantee.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as WISDOM (instructional, proverbial)
        - Recognize genre signals: "Hear, my son", comparison structures
        - AVOID: Treating proverbs as absolute legal commands or prophetic promises
        - NOTE: Helps avoid "prosperity gospel" misuse of Proverbs

    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Theodicy (suffering and God's justice)
      - Hermeneutics (dialogue vs. narrated truth)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Genre affects authority of statements:
      - POETRY-DIALOGUE: Speeches by Job, friends, Elihu - NOT always true,
        sometimes wrong (God rebukes friends in Job 42)
      - NARRATIVE: Framing story (Job 1-2, 42) - reliable narrator
      Treating dialogue as authoritative narrative leads to bad theology
      (friends' false accusations as divine truth).

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: poetry-dialogue  # Chapters 3-41 are poetic dialogue
      acceptable_alternatives: [wisdom-dialogue]
      forbidden_values: [narrative-authoritative]
      theological_basis: |
        Job 3-41 are poetic dialogues with unreliable speakers. God explicitly
        rebukes Job's friends (42:7). Dialogue ≠ divinely endorsed truth.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as POETRY-DIALOGUE or WISDOM-DIALOGUE
        - Distinguish dialogue (chapters 3-41) from narrative frame (1-2, 42)
        - CRITICAL: Do not treat friends' speeches as authoritative theology
        - Recognize God's rebuke of friends (42:7-8) as corrective

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Genre determines interpretation:
      - LOVE POETRY (LITERAL): Celebrates human marital love
      - ALLEGORY: Christ and Church, God and Israel
      Both have Christian tradition support. Genre affects application.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: poetry-lyric-love  # Primary: celebrates marital love
      acceptable_alternatives: [allegory-christological]  # Secondary: typological reading
      forbidden_values: [erotic-secular, mythology]
      theological_basis: |
        Two main Christian interpretations both orthodox:
        1. LITERAL: Celebrates God-ordained marital love (majority Protestant)
        2. ALLEGORICAL: Christ-Church relationship (Catholic, some Protestant)
        Both affirm goodness of marital love and Christ's love for Church.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as LOVE POETRY (lyric)
        - Allow for dual interpretation (literal + allegorical/typological)
        - AVOID: Secularizing (removing divine context) or mythologizing
        - DENOMINATIONAL VARIATION: Catholics emphasize allegory, Protestants literal

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Genre determines truth claims:
      - NARRATIVE: Historical event, Jonah literally swallowed by fish
      - PARABLE: Fictional teaching story, theological truth not historical
      Affects biblical authority debates.

    christian_orthodox_position:

      theological_basis: |
        Conservative Protestant orthodoxy: Historical narrative (Jesus references
        Jonah as historical in Matthew 12:40). Minority view: Parabolic teaching.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as NARRATIVE-PROPHETIC (historical)
        - Jesus' reference (Matthew 12:40) supports historicity
        - DENOMINATIONAL VARIATION: Some accept parabolic interpretation
        - AVOID: Mythological or purely fictional categories

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Genre affects application:
      - LEGAL: Direct commands, binding (at least for Israel), require obedience discussion
      - NARRATIVE: Story about legal giving, historical context
      Recognizing legal genre necessary for discussing Christian relationship to Mosaic law.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: legal  # Ten Commandments, Mosaic law are legal codes
      acceptable_alternatives: [legal-within-narrative-frame]
      forbidden_values: [narrative-only, wisdom-suggestions]
      theological_basis: |
        Mosaic law is legal code (commands, prohibitions, case law). Christians
        debate application (abrogated, fulfilled, moral vs. ceremonial) but
        recognize legal genre.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as LEGAL (apodictic commands, casuistic case law)
        - Recognize narrative frame (Exodus 19-20 introduction) vs. legal content
        - DENOMINATIONAL VARIATION: Application to Christians debated (Reformed
          theonomy, dispensationalism, New Covenant theology) but all recognize

      Genre affects interpretation:
      - EXPOSITORY: Theological explanation (Romans 1-11), requires understanding
      - HORTATORY: Ethical exhortation (Romans 12-16), requires obedience
      Epistolary frame (sender, recipient, situation) affects application to other contexts.

    christian_orthodox_position:

      forbidden_values: [narrative, legal-universal]  # Not narrative, not universal law code
      theological_basis: |
        Paul's letters are epistles (specific audience, situation) mixing theology
        (expository) and application (hortatory). Recognizing epistolary genre
        helps with contextualization.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as EPISTOLARY (letter to specific church/person)
        - Recognize expository sections (theological argument) vs. hortatory
          (ethical application)
        - Preserve epistolary formulas (greeting, thanksgiving, closing)

        biographical-theological accounts.
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Mark as GOSPEL or BIOGRAPHICAL-THEOLOGICAL NARRATIVE
        - Recognize both historical (events happened) and theological (arranged

arbitrary_contexts:

  - pattern: "Genealogies (Genesis 5, 10, Matthew 1, etc.)"
    rationale: |
      Whether classified as NARRATIVE, LEGAL-RECORD, or GENEALOGY subgenre does
      not affect theological interpretation. Translation treats similarly regardless.
    estimated_percentage: 2%

  - pattern: "Transitional verses between genre shifts"
    rationale: |
      Exact boundary of genre transition (e.g., narrative to direct speech, narrative
      to legal) is often ambiguous. Specific boundary placement does not affect theology.
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Historical narrative (most OT narrative, Acts)"
    rationale: |
      Distinguishing NARRATIVE from HISTORICAL-NARRATIVE subtype is stylistic.
      Both treated as historical accounts. Theological content unaffected.
    estimated_percentage: 40%

  - pattern: "Travel narratives (Paul's journeys in Acts)"
    rationale: |
      Whether marked as NARRATIVE or ITINERARY subgenre does not affect theology.
      Translation strategy similar regardless.
    estimated_percentage: 3%

  - pattern: "Discourse sections in narrative (speeches, prayers)"
    rationale: |
      Embedded speeches may be EXPOSITORY, HORTATORY, or remain NARRATIVE-SPEECH.
      Specific classification does not affect theological interpretation if
      speaker and context are clear.
    estimated_percentage: 15%

  - pattern: "Wisdom sayings in narrative contexts"
    rationale: |
      Occasional proverbs or wisdom statements within narrative (e.g., 1 Samuel 24:13)
      may be marked WISDOM or remain NARRATIVE. Does not affect interpretation.
    estimated_percentage: 2%

  - pattern: "Lists and catalogs (offerings, tribal counts, etc.)"
    rationale: |
      Whether marked as LEGAL-RECORD, PROCEDURAL, or NARRATIVE-LIST is stylistic.
      Translation treats as factual record regardless.
    estimated_percentage: 3%

  - pattern: "Prophetic oracles (typical prophecy)"
    rationale: |
      Most prophetic oracles clearly prophetic genre. Specific subtype (judgment,
      salvation, woe) is stylistic. Theological interpretation of specific oracle
      unaffected by subtype.
    estimated_percentage: 25%

  - pattern: "Poetry subtypes (hymn vs. lament vs. thanksgiving)"
    rationale: |
      All recognized as POETRY. Subtype classification (hymnic, lament, wisdom,
      royal, thanksgiving) helps but does not affect core theological content.

  note: |
    Discourse genre recognition affects INTERPRETATION and APPLICATION more than
    DOCTRINE directly. Most genre errors lead to misinterpretation (medium stakes)
    rather than heresy (high stakes). However, persistent genre confusion (e.g.,
    literalizing all apocalyptic, allegorizing all narrative) can lead to systemic
    theological error.

# ==============================================================================
# THEOLOGICAL GUIDANCE FOR TRANSLATORS
# ==============================================================================

translator_guidance:
  general_principle: |
    Discourse genre is CONTEXTUALLY CRITICAL. Misidentifying genre leads to:
    1. INTERPRETATION ERRORS: Wrong hermeneutical approach (literal vs. symbolic)
    2. APPLICATION ERRORS: Wrong life application (wisdom as absolute promise)
    3. DOCTRINAL DRIFT: Accumulated genre errors create theological confusion

  high_priority_checks:
    - "Genesis 1-2: Ensure treated as NARRATIVE (not mythology), note elevated style"
    - "Revelation: Mark as APOCALYPTIC (not literal narrative), preserve symbolism"
    - "Parables: Clearly signal PARABLE genre, avoid historical confusion"
    - "Psalms: Preserve POETIC features, avoid literalizing metaphors"
    - "Proverbs: Mark as WISDOM (general principles), not absolute promises"
    - "Job 3-41: Distinguish DIALOGUE from narrative frame, note unreliable speakers"
    - "Legal codes: Mark as LEGAL, helps with Christian application discussion"
    - "Epistles: Preserve EPISTOLARY frame, note expository vs. hortatory sections"

  denominational_sensitivities:
    - "Genesis 1-2: Framework hypothesis (poetry) is minority Reformed view"
    - "Song of Solomon: Catholics emphasize allegory, Protestants literal love poetry"
    - "Jonah: Most conservatives affirm historical, some allow parabolic"
    - "Mosaic Law: Application debated (theonomy, dispensationalism, NCT) but all
      recognize legal genre"
    - "Revelation: Eschatological views differ (premil, amil, postmil) but all
      recognize apocalyptic genre"

  avoid_errors:
    - "NEVER treat apocalyptic as plain narrative (leads to bizarre literalization)"
    - "NEVER treat parables as historical events (creates false history)"
    - "NEVER treat poetry as prose (over-literalizes metaphors)"
    - "NEVER treat wisdom as legal promises (creates prosperity gospel errors)"
    - "NEVER treat dialogue as authoritative narration (Job's friends' errors as truth)"
    - "NEVER treat narrative as mythology (undermines biblical authority)"
