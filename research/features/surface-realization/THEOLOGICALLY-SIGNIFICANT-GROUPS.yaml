feature: surface-realization
default_classification: arbitrary  # Default: Surface realization choice is stylistic/optional
theological_significance: LOW       # Surface form (NP/pronoun/zero/clitic) rarely affects doctrine

# CRITICAL CONTEXT:
# Surface Realization (Noun vs Pronoun vs Zero vs Clitic) is about HOW a participant
# is expressed, not WHO the participant is or WHAT they are doing. In most cases,
# the choice between "God said" vs "He said" vs "[zero] said" does NOT change meaning.
#
# HOWEVER: Ambiguous reference (unclear "he"/"they") CAN create confusion that
# affects interpretation. This is a NARRATIVE CLARITY issue, not a DOCTRINAL issue.

# SECTION 1: NON-ARBITRARY (High Clarity Stakes)
# =============================================================================

non_arbitrary_contexts:

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1.1 AMBIGUOUS REFERENCE - Multiple Potential Referents
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: "Genesis 4:8 - Cain and Abel narrative (unverified)"
    affected_values: [zero, pronoun, noun]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM  # Narrative clarity, not core doctrine
    affected_doctrines:
      - Biblical narrative accuracy
      - Faithful representation of events

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      When MULTIPLE participants of the same gender/number are active,
      using ZERO or PRONOUN can create ambiguity about WHO did WHAT.

      Example: "Cain rose up against Abel, and [he] killed [him]."
      - Question: Who killed whom? (Cain killed Abel, but pronoun could confuse)

      In Hebrew, TBTA marks this with:
      - Cain = Noun List Index 1
      - Abel = Noun List Index 2
      - Both can be ZERO (pro-drop), but target language may require explicitness

      This is NOT a theological issue (we know from context that Cain killed Abel),
      but it IS a narrative clarity issue. Poor surface realization choices can
      create confusion that makes readers doubt the translation's accuracy.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: noun  # Use full NP when ambiguity possible
      acceptable_alternatives: [pronoun]  # Pronoun OK if context absolutely clear
      forbidden_values: []  # No forbidden values; zero is risky but not heretical
      theological_basis: "Biblical narrative must be clear and accurate."
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Use NOUN (full NP) when multiple same-gender participants active
        - SECOND CHOICE: Use PRONOUN if target language allows and context is clear
        - RISKY: ZERO (pro-drop) may confuse readers in ambiguous contexts
        - NEVER: Do not create ambiguity that makes readers question accuracy

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: []  # No heretical interpretations from surface form

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1.2 PARTICIPANT INTRODUCTION - First Mention vs Continuation
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: "Narrative first mentions (e.g., Gen 1:1 'God created') (unverified)"
    affected_values: [noun, pronoun, zero]
    theological_stakes: LOW
    affected_doctrines:
      - Narrative coherence

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      FIRST MENTION of a participant typically requires NOUN (full NP), not pronoun/zero.

      Example: Genesis 1:1 "In the beginning, GOD created..."
      - Cannot start with "He created" (pronoun) - who is "he"?
      - Cannot start with "[zero] created" - reference unclear

      This is a UNIVERSAL discourse principle (Givón 1983, Lambrecht 1994):
      - NEW referents → NOUN (full NP)
      - GIVEN referents → PRONOUN or ZERO

      However, this is NOT a theological issue. It's a discourse convention.
      All languages follow this pattern (though some allow inference from world knowledge).

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: noun  # Always use full NP for first mentions
      acceptable_alternatives: []  # No alternatives for first mentions
      forbidden_values: []  # Not forbidden theologically, just pragmatically odd
      theological_basis: "Clarity of reference honors the biblical text."
      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Use NOUN (full NP) when introducing a participant
        - After introduction, PRONOUN or ZERO may be appropriate (depending on language)
        - This is DISCOURSE CONVENTION, not THEOLOGICAL REQUIREMENT

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1.3 SUBJECT-OBJECT TRACKING - Avoiding Confusion
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: "Complex narratives with many participants (e.g., Acts, Gospel passion narratives) (unverified)"
    affected_values: [zero, pronoun, noun]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Historical accuracy of biblical events
      - Trustworthiness of Scripture

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      In narratives with MANY participants (Acts, Gospels), excessive use of ZERO
      or PRONOUN can create confusion about WHO is acting.

      Example: Acts 16:16-40 (Paul, Silas, jailer, magistrates, crowd)
      - Multiple "he"s and "they"s
      - Hebrew/Greek can use ZERO (pro-drop) when continuity is high
      - Target language may REQUIRE explicit NOUNS to track participants

      This affects:
      - NARRATIVE CLARITY (primary concern)
      - READER TRUST (readers may question translation if confused)
      - NOT CORE DOCTRINE (events are not disputed, only clarity of reference)

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: noun  # Use NOUN when participant tracking is complex
      acceptable_alternatives: [pronoun]  # Pronoun OK if language has clear agreement
      forbidden_values: []
      theological_basis: "Scripture is trustworthy and should be clear to readers."
      translator_guidance: |
        - Use NOUN (full NP) when reintroducing participants after absence
        - Use NOUN when multiple participants of same gender/number are active
        - PRONOUN acceptable if agreement morphology makes reference clear
        - ZERO acceptable in pro-drop languages if discourse context is unambiguous
        - PRIORITY: Prevent reader confusion over excessive pronouns

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: []

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1.4 DEITY REFERENCE - Respect and Clarity (Cultural, Not Theological)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: "References to God, Jesus, Holy Spirit (all contexts) (unverified)"
    affected_values: [pronoun, zero]
    theological_stakes: LOW  # Cultural/stylistic, not doctrinal
    affected_doctrines:
      - Reverence for God (cultural expression, not doctrine)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Some translation traditions prefer to use NOUN (full NP) for deity references
      rather than PRONOUN or ZERO, even when discourse continuity is high.

      Example: "God said... God created... God saw..."
      vs. "God said... He created... He saw..."

      This is a STYLISTIC CHOICE, not a theological requirement:
      - Using "He" for God is NOT disrespectful in most cultures
      - Some cultures prefer explicit divine names for reverence
      - This varies by target culture, not by orthodox theology

      IMPORTANT: This is NOT about:
      - Trinity (that's handled by Number System: Trial vs Plural)
      - Person of Christ (that's handled by semantic content, not surface form)
      - Deity of Christ (that's handled by predicate, not subject form)

      Surface Realization (Noun vs Pronoun) does NOT affect these doctrines.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: noun  # CULTURAL preference, not theological requirement
      acceptable_alternatives: [pronoun, zero]  # Equally orthodox
      forbidden_values: []
      theological_basis: "Reverence for God varies by culture; no biblical mandate for surface form."
      translator_guidance: |
        - CULTURAL CHOICE: Some traditions prefer "God" over "He" for reverence
        - EQUALLY VALID: Using pronouns for deity is orthodox and common
        - SOURCE TEXT: Hebrew/Greek frequently use pronouns/zeros for God
        - TARGET CULTURE: Decide based on local norms, not theology
        - NOT A DOCTRINAL ISSUE: Pronoun vs Noun does not affect God's nature

# SECTION 2: ARBITRARY (Stylistic/Optional Choices)
# =============================================================================

arbitrary_contexts:

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2.1 HIGH TOPIC CONTINUITY - Same Subject, Multiple Clauses
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - pattern: "Discourse continuity (same subject in consecutive clauses)"
    rationale: |
      When the same participant continues as subject across multiple clauses,
      the choice of NOUN vs PRONOUN vs ZERO is STYLISTIC, not meaningful.

      Example: "Paul went to the synagogue. [He] preached. [He] left."

      All of these are EQUALLY VALID:
      1. "Paul went... Paul preached... Paul left." (repeated NOUN)
      2. "Paul went... He preached... He left." (PRONOUN continuation)
      3. "Paul went... [zero] preached... [zero] left." (ZERO in pro-drop languages)

      The choice depends on:
      - Target language typology (pro-drop vs non-pro-drop)
      - Discourse style (formal vs colloquial)
      - Translation tradition (more/less explicit)

      This is ARBITRARY because the meaning is identical in all cases.

    estimated_percentage: 70%
    affected_languages:
      - Pro-drop languages (Spanish, Italian, Japanese, etc.): Use ZERO or PRONOUN
      - Non-pro-drop languages (English, French, German): Use PRONOUN
      - Style varies by translator preference

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2.2 OBJECT PRONOUNS AND CLITICS
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - pattern: "Object realization (direct/indirect objects)"
    rationale: |
      When expressing objects (not subjects), the choice between NOUN, PRONOUN,
      CLITIC, or ZERO is almost always ARBITRARY.

      Example: "I saw John" vs "I saw him"

      Both are equally valid; choice depends on:
      - Is the object discourse-new (→ NOUN) or discourse-given (→ PRONOUN)?
      - Does the target language have clitics (Romance) or only full pronouns (English)?

      This is STYLISTIC and follows discourse conventions, not theology.

    estimated_percentage: 80%

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2.3 POSSESSIVE CONSTRUCTIONS
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - pattern: "Possessor realization (his house, the man's house)"
    rationale: |
      Whether to use PRONOUN ("his house") vs NOUN ("the man's house") is
      typically determined by discourse context (is possessor given or new?).

      This is ARBITRARY from a theological perspective.

    estimated_percentage: 90%

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2.4 GENERIC AND IMPERSONAL CONSTRUCTIONS
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - pattern: "Generic/impersonal subjects (one, people, they)"
    rationale: |
      Generic subjects ("one must...", "people say...", "they claim...") vary
      widely across languages in surface realization:
      - Some use PRONOUN ("they", "one")
      - Some use ZERO (no overt subject)
      - Some use impersonal verb forms

      This is ENTIRELY ARBITRARY - all express the same generic meaning.

    estimated_percentage: 95%

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 2.5 REPORTED SPEECH ATTRIBUTION
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - pattern: "Speech attribution (he said, Jesus said)"
    rationale: |
      In reported speech, whether to repeat the speaker's name (NOUN) or use
      a pronoun/zero is STYLISTIC:

      Example:
      - "Jesus said, '...' He continued, '...' He concluded, '...'" (PRONOUN)
      - "Jesus said, '...' Jesus continued, '...' Jesus concluded, '...'" (NOUN)

      Both are equally clear and equally orthodox. Choice depends on style.

    estimated_percentage: 75%

# =============================================================================
# OVERALL SUMMARY
# =============================================================================

overall_assessment:
  theological_impact: MINIMAL
  narrative_clarity_impact: MODERATE
  translation_difficulty: HIGH  # Because typologies vary widely

  key_insight: |
    Surface Realization is PRIMARILY a TYPOLOGICAL feature, not a THEOLOGICAL one.

    The challenge is NOT "What does God's Word say?" (that's clear from context)
    but rather "How does the target language EXPRESS participants?"

    Languages differ dramatically:
    - English REQUIRES explicit pronouns
    - Spanish ALLOWS pro-drop (zero subjects)
    - Japanese PREFERS pro-drop (overt pronouns sound unnatural)
    - Swahili USES subject prefixes (no independent pronouns)

    Translators must:
    1. Understand SOURCE language surface realization (Hebrew/Greek both pro-drop)
    2. Understand TARGET language requirements (obligatory vs optional pronouns)
    3. Balance FIDELITY (preserve source patterns) vs CLARITY (target language norms)

    This is a LINGUISTIC challenge, not a THEOLOGICAL one.

  recommended_approach: |
    TBTA should provide:
    1. SOURCE language annotation (what Hebrew/Greek actually used)
    2. DISCOURSE context (Participant Tracking, Noun List Index, Referential Distance)
    3. PREDICTED target needs (does target language require explicit marking?)

    Translators then make INFORMED STYLISTIC CHOICES based on:
    - Target language typology (pro-drop vs non-pro-drop)
    - Target culture norms (honorifics, formality)
    - Translation tradition (more/less explicit)

    Goal: ACCURATE and NATURAL translation, not wooden literalism.
