# Scholarly Research: Person Systems & Clusivity

## Executive Summary

Person is a universal grammatical category distinguishing speaker (1st), addressee (2nd), and others (3rd). **Clusivity**—the inclusive/exclusive distinction in 1st person plural—affects ~31.5% of world languages and is critical for Bible translation. The feature is nearly universal in Austronesian, common in the Americas and Australia, but absent from Indo-European (except Caucasus).

**Theological challenges** arise because Hebrew/Greek lack clusivity marking, requiring translators to disambiguate contexts like Gen 1:26 (Trinity: inclusive "we"), Acts 15:25 (apostles: exclusive "we"), and the Lord's Prayer (humans: exclusive "we" excluding God). Wrong choices can create heresy (e.g., implying God shares in human sin).

## 1. Scholarly Sources

### 1.1 Elena Filimonova (2005): *Clusivity: Typology and Case Studies of the Inclusive-Exclusive Distinction*

**Publisher**: John Benjamins, Amsterdam/Philadelphia (Typological Studies in Language, Vol. 63)
**Pages**: 436
**Citation Code**: {filimonova-2005-clusivity}

**Key Findings**:
- **First comprehensive exploration** of clusivity across languages
- **15 papers** covering typological patterns, geographic distribution, and language-specific case studies
- **Themes addressed**:
  - Categorical/paradigmatic status of inclusive/exclusive opposition
  - Geographic distribution (Austronesian, Tibeto-Burman, central-western South America, Turkic)
  - Free vs bound pronoun realization
  - Inclusive imperatives
  - Second-person clusivity (controversial)

### 1.2 Greville G. Corbett (2000): *Number*

**Publisher**: Cambridge University Press (Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics)
**Citation Code**: {corbett-2000-number}

**Key Findings**:
- **Person hierarchy** (empathy hierarchy) for number marking:
  - **1st person > 2nd person > 3rd person > kin > human > animate > inanimate**
  - **Universal**: If a number distinction (e.g., dual) appears at any point on this hierarchy, it appears at all points to the left
  - **Implication**: Clusivity (a 1st-person feature) is more likely than 3rd-person clusivity

- **Agreement phenomena**:
  - Person features interact with number in agreement systems
  - Hybrid nouns permit variable agreement sensitive to target type
  - Agreement hierarchy: attributive modifiers > predicates > relative pronouns > personal pronouns

**Example Application to Clusivity**:
- Languages with dual number often mark clusivity in 1st-person dual (e.g., Australian languages: *ngali* incl vs *ngaliju* excl)
- Clusivity is higher-priority than some number distinctions (trial, paucal) due to person hierarchy

**Relevance for TBTA**:
- Explains why clusivity appears cross-linguistically
- Predicts interaction between person and number features
- Provides framework for understanding Gen 1:26 (1st person inclusive + trial number = Trinity)

### 1.3 Bernard Comrie (1989): *Language Universals and Linguistic Typology: Syntax and Morphology*

**Publisher**: University of Chicago Press (2nd edition)
**Citation Code**: {comrie-1989-universals}

**Key Findings**:
- **Pioneering work** in typological linguistics, especially morphosyntactic universals
- **Person and number** treated as fundamental grammatical categories
- **Cross-linguistic approach**: Keeps comparison constant across wide variation, sometimes ignoring language-specific details

**Notable Contributions**:
- Analysis of syntactic/semantic universals relevant to person systems
- Word order, case marking, relative clauses (interact with person agreement)
- Comrie **attested second-person clusivity** in spoken languages, though this is controversial among linguists

**Relevance for TBTA**:
- Provides theoretical foundation for understanding person as a universal category
- Framework for analyzing Hebrew/Greek person systems vs target languages

**Source**: https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/L/bo24426144.html

### 1.4 Domingo de Santo Tomás (1560): *Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Peru*

**Context**: First European description of Quechua
**Citation Code**: {santo-tomas-1560-quechua}

**Historical Significance**:
- **First recorded discovery of clusivity** by a European scholar
- Dominican friar documenting Quechua (Incan language)
- Identified that Quechua has **two different words for "we"**—one including the listener, one excluding

**Relevance**:
- Marks the beginning of European awareness of clusivity
- Until this discovery, European linguists assumed all languages worked like Latin/Greek/Spanish (no clusivity)
- Shows clusivity was overlooked for centuries due to Indo-European bias

**Source**: Wikipedia - Clusivity

### 1.5 Bobaljik & Sauerland: *About 'Us': Clusivity*

**Publisher**: Harvard University (working paper)
**Citation Code**: {bobaljik-sauerland-clusivity}

**Key Findings**:
- **Semantic analysis** of inclusive vs exclusive pronouns
- Formal linguistic treatment of clusivity using features and semantics
- Argues for treating clusivity as a **distinct feature** rather than derived from person+number

**Relevance**:
- Theoretical justification for TBTA's separate annotation of clusivity
- Explains why clusivity cannot be predicted from context alone (requires explicit annotation)

## 2. Typological Databases

### 2.1 WALS Feature 39: Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Independent Pronouns

**Author**: Michael Cysouw (2005)
**Citation Code**: {wals-39-clusivity}

**Values Tracked**:
1. **No inclusive/exclusive distinction** (137/200 languages = 68.5%)
2. **Inclusive/exclusive distinction** (63/200 languages = 31.5%)
3. **No first-person plural pronoun** (rare)

**Key Data**:
- **31.5% of languages** in WALS sample distinguish inclusive/exclusive
- **Geographic clusters**:
  - Nearly universal: Austronesian, northern Australian
  - Common: Americas (North, Central, South), parts of Asia
  - Rare: Africa, Eurasia (except Caucasus)
  - Absent: All of Europe (except Caucasus)

**Implication for Bible Translation**:
- Roughly **1 in 3 Bible translations** will require clusivity disambiguation
- ~300 of our 1000 languages likely mark clusivity (matches our database analysis: ~250-300 Austronesian + ~30 Australian)

**Map**: https://wals.info/chapter/39 shows global distribution

**Relevance**:
- Provides quantitative baseline for clusivity prevalence
- Validates TBTA's Tier A classification (affects 1000+ languages globally)

### 2.2 APICS (Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures) - Feature 15

**Citation Code**: {apics-15-clusivity}

**Key Findings**:
- **Creole languages** sometimes acquire clusivity from substrate/superstrate
- Example: Tok Pisin (Papua New Guinea English creole)
  - Singular: *mi* (I)
  - Exclusive: *mi-pela* (we, not including you)
  - Inclusive: *yu-mi* (you + me) or *yu-mi-pela*
  - Transparent compounding: *yu-mi* literally "you-me"

**Implication**:
- Shows clusivity can be **transparently encoded** in some languages
- Tok Pisin's *yu-mi* makes inclusive/exclusive semantically obvious (unlike opaque Tagalog *tayo*/*kami*)

**Source**: https://apics-online.info/parameters/15.chapter.html

## 3. Translation Case Studies

### 3.1 Kwara'ae (Solomon Islands, Austronesian): The Lord's Prayer Error

**Source**: TIPs Translation Database
**Citation Code**: {tips-kwara-ae-lords-prayer}

**Context**: Matthew 6:13 / Luke 11:4 - "Forgive us our trespasses"

**Translation Error**:
- **Early missionaries** used **inclusive "we"** (including God in "our trespasses")
- This implied **God shares in human sin** with the pray-ers
- Theologically **heretical** (God is sinless)

**Correction**:
- Changed to **exclusive "we"** (we humans sinned, not you God)

**Theological Lesson**:
- **Exclusive "we"** excludes the addressee (God) from the sinning group
- Wrong clusivity choice can create **heresy**, not just awkwardness
- Translators must carefully analyze **participant roles** in prayer texts

**Source**: https://tips.translation.bible/story/inclusive-vs-exclusive-pronoun-matt-613/

---

### 3.2 Fijian (Austronesian): Genesis 1:26 - "Let Us Make Man"

**Context**: Genesis 1:26 - God says, "Let us make man in our image"

**Hebrew**: נַעֲשֶׂה אָדָם בְּצַלְמֵנוּ (*na'aseh adam b'tzalmenu*)
- 1st person plural cohortative verb (*na'aseh* = "let us make")
- 1st person plural possessive suffix (*-enu* = "our")
- **NO clusivity marking** in Hebrew

**Fijian Translation Challenge**:
- Fijian **requires** clusivity marking in all plural pronouns
- Options:
  1. **Inclusive**: God addresses humanity (includes humans in "us") - **REJECTED** (humans don't create)
  2. **Exclusive**: God speaks within Godhead, excluding humanity
  3. **Trial number + Inclusive**: Exactly 3 persons (Trinity) speaking to each other

**TBTA Annotation**:
- Person: **First Inclusive**
- Number: **Trial** (exactly 3)
- Interpretation: **Trinity** (Father, Son, Holy Spirit deliberating together)

**Alternative Interpretations** (rejected by Christian orthodoxy):
- Divine council (God + angels): Would use **Inclusive** but not Trial
- Polytheism: Would use different number combinations
- Royal "we" (plural of majesty): Would use **Exclusive Plural**, not Trial

**Source**: TBTA Data Structure documentation, Bible translation discussions

### 3.3 Tagalog (Philippines, Austronesian): Acts 15:25 - "It Seemed Good to Us"

**Context**: Acts 15:25 - Jerusalem Council letter to Gentile churches

**Greek**: ἔδοξεν ἡμῖν (*edoxen hēmin*) = "it seemed good to us"
- 1st person plural dative pronoun
- **NO clusivity marking** in Greek

**Tagalog Translation**:
- Must choose between:
  - **Inclusive**: *sa atin* (to us, including you Gentile readers) - **WRONG**
  - **Exclusive**: *sa amin* (to us apostles/elders, not including you) - **CORRECT**

**Exegetical Reasoning**:
- **Speaker**: Apostles and elders in Jerusalem
- **Addressee**: Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, Cilicia
- **Context**: "The apostles and elders... send greeting" (v. 23)
- **Decision-makers**: Jerusalem council members only
- **Conclusion**: "Us" = council members, excluding recipients → **Exclusive**

**TBTA Annotation**: Person = "First Exclusive"

**Translation Impact**:
- **Inclusive** would wrongly imply the Gentile recipients participated in the decision
- **Exclusive** correctly shows apostolic authority making decision **for** (not **with**) the churches

**Source**: TBTA Data Structure, TIPs Bible Translation

### 3.4 Galatians 2:15 - Ambiguous Context

**Context**: Paul's letter to Galatians
**Greek**: ἡμεῖς φύσει Ἰουδαῖοι (*hēmeis physei Ioudaioi*) = "we ourselves, who are Jews by birth"

**Ambiguity**:
- **Option 1**: Paul continues quoting his speech to Peter in Antioch → **Inclusive** (includes Peter)
- **Option 2**: Paul shifts to address Galatian audience → **Exclusive** (Paul + Jewish Christians, not Gentile Galatians)

**Scholarly Disagreement**:
- Velma Pickett & Florence Cowan (1962): Recommend **inclusive**
- SIL International (1999): Leans toward **exclusive** (but notes uncertainty)
- Greek text itself is **obscure**—no clear boundary marker between direct speech and narrative

**Translation Decisions**:
- Different languages made different choices based on exegetical analysis
- Illustrates that **not all clusivity contexts are determinable**
- Translators must sometimes make **interpretive judgment calls**

**Source**: https://tips.translation.bible/story/inclusive-vs-exclusive-pronoun-gal-215/

### 3.5 Vietnamese: Register and Clusivity Interaction

**Context**: Vietnamese marks clusivity AND formality

**System**:
- Familiar singular *ta* (I) → Inclusive *chúng ta* (we, including you)
- Formal singular *tôi* (I) → Exclusive *chúng tôi* (we, excluding you)

**Pattern**: The formality level of the singular pronoun **carries into** the plural and correlates with clusivity

**Implication for Bible Translation**:
- Choosing inclusive vs exclusive also affects **register/politeness**
- In prayers: Formal *tôi* → Exclusive *chúng tôi* (appropriate for addressing God)
- In exhortations: Familiar *ta* → Inclusive *chúng ta* (speaker includes audience)

## 4. Extended Person Systems (Beyond 1st/2nd/3rd)

### 4.1 Fourth Person: Obviation (Algonquian Languages)

**Context**: Algonquian languages (Cree, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Cheyenne)
**Citation Code**: {obviation-algonquian}

**Definition**:
- **Proximate** (3rd person): Most salient/topical third-person referent
- **Obviative** (4th person): Less salient third-person referent(s)
- When multiple 3rd-person entities in discourse, one is marked "nearer" (proximate), others "farther" (obviative)

**Morphological Marking**:
- Nouns, pronouns, and verbs change form to show proximate vs obviative status
- **Proximate** = unmarked (default)
- **Obviative** = marked with suffix (e.g., Ojibwe *-an*)

**Example (Cheyenne)**:
- "The man [proximate] saw the woman [obviative]" - the man is more topical
- Verb agrees with proximate argument

**Further Obviation** (Potawatomi):
- Two degrees: "obviative" and "further obviative" (even less salient)

**Relevance for TBTA**:
- TBTA does **NOT** annotate obviation (no "4th person" in documentation)
- Our database has Algonquin (alq) and Blackfoot (bla) - could investigate if needed
- Obviation is **NOT clusivity** (different feature entirely)

**Source**: https://lingodigest.com/the-fourth-person-obviation-explained/

### 4.2 Zero Person / Generic Person (Finnish, Finnic Languages)

**Context**: Finnish, Estonian, other Finnic languages
**Citation Code**: {finnish-zero-person}

**Definition**:
- **Zero person**: Verb in 3rd person singular with **no subject**
- **Finnish passive**: Impersonal construction (sometimes called "4th person")
- **Generic reference**: "One does X" / "People do X" / "It is done"

**Examples**:
- Finnish: *Ei saa koskettaa* = "Not allowed to touch" (lit. "not gets to-touch")
- Colloquial 1PL: *Mennään!* = "Let's go!" (passive form replacing active *me menemme*)

**Relevance for TBTA**:
- TBTA does **NOT** document zero person / generic person
- Hebrew/Greek have impersonal constructions (e.g., divine passives), but TBTA does not annotate this as a person feature
- Not applicable to clusivity annotation

**Source**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_grammar

---

### 4.3 Second-Person Clusivity (Controversial)

**Claim**: Some linguists argue for second-person clusivity (distinguishing "you" vs "you and others")

**Evidence**:
- **Bernard Comrie** attested second-person clusivity in some languages
- **Counterargument**: Other linguists maintain human cognition lacks capacity for 2nd-person clusivity
- **Filimonova (2005)** includes chapter by Horst J. Simon: "Only you?: Philological investigations into the alleged inclusive-exclusive distinction in the second person plural"
  - Conclusion: **Not well attested** in natural languages

**Relevance for TBTA**:
- TBTA does **NOT** mark second-person clusivity
- Not relevant for Biblical Hebrew/Greek (which also lack it)

**Source**: Wikipedia - Clusivity, Filimonova (2005)

---

## 5. Linguistic Universals & Hierarchies

### 5.1 Person Hierarchy (Corbett's Empathy Hierarchy)

**Hierarchy**:
```
1st person > 2nd person > 3rd person > kin > human > animate > inanimate
```

**Universal**: If a grammatical distinction (e.g., number, clusivity) appears at point X on the hierarchy, it appears at all points to the left

**Application to Clusivity**:
- Clusivity is a **1st-person feature** (highest on hierarchy)
- Predicted to be **more common** than 2nd/3rd person distinctions
- Explains why clusivity is cross-linguistically frequent (~31%) despite being absent from Indo-European

**Source**: {corbett-2000-number}

---

### 5.2 Agreement Hierarchy

**Corbett's Agreement Hierarchy**:
```
Attributive modifiers > Predicates > Relative pronouns > Personal pronouns
```

**Relevance**:
- Person features show **most agreement** with attributive modifiers
- **Least agreement** with personal pronouns
- TBTA annotates person on nouns/pronouns, not verbs (despite many languages showing verb agreement)

---

## 6. Historical Development of Clusivity

### 6.1 How Clusivity Arises

**Transparent Origins**:
- **Tok Pisin**: *yu-mi* = "you + me" (transparently inclusive)
- **Vietnamese**: Singular pronouns (*ta* vs *tôi*) pluralize differently → clusivity distinction

**Opaque Origins**:
- **Tagalog**: *tayo* (incl) vs *kami* (excl) - etymologically opaque
- **Malay**: *kita* (incl) vs *kami* (excl) - reconstructed to Proto-Austronesian

**Back-formation**:
- **Tamil**: Proto-Dravidian *ñām* (1PL inclusive) → back-formed *ñān* (1SG), paralleling *yāṉ* (1SG) from *yām*

**Substrate Influence**:
- **Mandarin Chinese**: Acquired 咱们 *zánmen* (inclusive) from Altaic languages (Mongolian, Manchu, Turkic) after late Tang dynasty
- **Indo-European (India)**: Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, Odia acquired clusivity from Dravidian substrate

**Source**: https://linguistlist.org/issues/729/, Language Log

---

### 6.2 Loss of Clusivity

**Malay (colloquial)**:
- *Kami* (exclusive) falling out of everyday use
- *Kita* (originally inclusive) becoming general "we" for both functions
- **Implication**: Clusivity distinctions can **erode** in some languages

**Source**: Medium - The Many Faces of 'We'
