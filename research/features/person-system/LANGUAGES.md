# Language Family & Typology Analysis: Person Systems & Clusivity

## Executive Summary

Grammatical person systems vary from simple 3-way (1st/2nd/3rd) to complex systems including clusivity (inclusive/exclusive distinction in first person plural). **Critical finding**: Hebrew and Greek do NOT encode clus ivity morphologically, but approximately **31.5% of world languages do** {wals-clusivity-2025}. This feature is **nearly universal in Austronesian** (1000+ languages), common in Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, but **rare in Europe and Africa** {wikipedia-clusivity-2025}.

**Translation Impact**: For ~1/3 of world languages, translators must disambiguate every "we" in Scripture based on context—getting it wrong can alter theological meaning (e.g., Trinity references, apostolic authority).

## 1. Source Language Encoding (Hebrew & Greek)

### CRITICAL: Clusivity is NOT Encoded in Biblical Source Languages

**Hebrew**:
- First person singular: אֲנִי (ani), אָנֹכִי (anokhi)
- First person plural: אֲנַחְנוּ (anachnu), נוּ (nu suffix)
- **NO** morphological distinction between inclusive/exclusive "we"

**Greek (Koine)**:
- First person singular: ἐγώ (egō)
- First person plural: ἡμεῖς (hēmeis), ἡμῶν (hēmōn), ἡμῖν (hēmin), ἡμᾶς (hēmas)
- **NO** morphological distinction between inclusive/exclusive "we"

{koine-greek-clusivity-2025}

**Implication**: All clusivity annotations in TBTA (and all translations into clusivity-marking languages) are **INTERPRETIVE**, based on contextual/exegetical analysis, not morphological encoding.

## 2. Global Distribution of Clusivity

### Geographic Patterns

From WALS chapter 39 {wals-clusivity-2025}:

| Region | Prevalence | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Austronesia** | Nearly universal | ~1000+ languages |
| **Northern Australia** | Nearly universal | All surveyed languages |
| **Americas** | Common | North, Central, South America |
| **Asia (South/SE)** | Common | Dravidian, some Sino-Tibetan, Vietnamese |
| **Papuan** | Rare | Despite proximity to Austronesian |
| **Europe** | Absent (except Caucasus) | No Indo-European outside Caucasus |
| **Africa** | Sporadic | Rare in Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan |

### Statistical Prevalence

- **31.5%** of world languages show inclusive/exclusive distinction (WALS sample of 200 languages: 63 with distinction, 137 without) {wals-clusivity-2025}
- **68.5%** of languages do NOT mark clusivity
- Among languages WITH clusivity, the feature is often **obligatory** (must be marked on every first person plural pronoun)

## 3. Language Family Analysis

### Families That REQUIRE Clusivity (Mandatory)

#### Austronesian (Nearly Universal)

The inclusive–exclusive distinction occurs **nearly universally among the Austronesian languages** {wikipedia-clusivity-2025}.

**Examples from our translation database**:

| Language (ISO) | Family | Example Pronouns | Country | Status |
|----------------|--------|------------------|---------|--------|
| **Tagalog** (tgl) | Austronesian | *tayo* (incl) vs *kami* (excl) | Philippines | Mandatory |
| **Malay** (zlm) | Austronesian | *kita* (incl) vs *kami* (excl) | Malaysia/Indonesia | Mandatory (but *kami* falling out of use) |
| **Fijian** (fij) | Austronesian | Dual/trial/plural all distinguish | Fiji | Mandatory |
| **Cebuano** (ceb) | Austronesian | Similar to Tagalog | Philippines | Mandatory (suspected) |
| **Chuukese** (chk) | Austronesian | Micronesian system | Micronesia | Mandatory (suspected) |
| **Chamorro** (cha) | Austronesian | Micronesian system | Guam | Mandatory (suspected) |

**Additional Austronesian languages in our database** (likely mandatory, pending verification):
- Miniafia (aai), Ankave (aak), Abau (aau), Amarasi (aaz), Ambulas (abt), Inabaknon (abx)
- 200+ more Austronesian languages from Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Indonesia, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Micronesia

#### Australian Languages (Nearly Universal)

**Examples from our database**:

| Language (ISO) | Example | Country | Status |
|----------------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Arrernte, Eastern** (aer) | Dual: *ngali* (incl) vs *ngaliju* (excl) | Australia | Mandatory |
| **Alyawarr** (aly) | Similar to Arrernte | Australia | Mandatory (suspected) |
| **Burarra** (bvr) | Northern Australian | Australia | Mandatory (suspected) |

Many Australian languages distinguish clusivity **especially in dual number** {wals-clusivity-2025}.

#### Dravidian Languages

**Most Dravidian languages have a clusivity distinction** {wikipedia-clusivity-2025}.

**Examples**:
- **Tamil**: *ñām* (inclusive) vs *yām* (exclusive) - not in our database
- **Telugu**: *mana-* (inclusive) vs *ma-* (exclusive) - not in our database
- Dravidian clusivity was borrowed into some Indo-European languages of India (Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi) as substrate {wikipedia-clusivity-2025}

**Note**: No Dravidian languages found in our current translation database.

#### Sino-Tibetan (Partial - Northern Mandarin)

**Mandarin Chinese** (cmn):
- Inclusive: 咱们 *zánmen* (you and I and possibly others)
- Ambiguous/Exclusive: 我们 *wǒmen* (I and others, may or may not include you)
- **Status**: Optional/contextual (not strictly exclusive)
- **Historical note**: Acquired from Altaic languages (Mongolian, Manchu, Turkic) after late Tang {languagelog-clusivity-2025}

Other Sino-Tibetan:
- **Burmese (Chin languages)** in our database (cek, csy, cth): Mandatory (suspected)

#### Quechuan, Aymaran (South America)

Discovered in **1560 by Domingo de Santo Tomás** (first description of clusivity) {wikipedia-clusivity-2025}.

**Not represented in our database** - but historically significant for identifying the feature.

### Families That LACK Clusivity (Absent)

#### Indo-European (with rare exceptions)

**NO European language outside the Caucasus makes this distinction grammatically** {wikipedia-clusivity-2025}.

**Languages in our database WITHOUT clusivity**:
- **English** (eng): No distinction
- **Spanish** (spa): No distinction
- **German** (deu): No distinction
- **French** (fra): No distinction (assumed - not explicitly in database but standard Indo-European)
- **Russian** (rus): No distinction (assumed)
- **Greek** (Modern): No distinction (Koine Greek also lacks it)

**Note**: Some Indo-European languages of India acquired clusivity as substrate from Dravidian (Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi) {wikipedia-clusivity-2025}, but these are not in our database.

#### Afro-Asiatic

**Hebrew, Arabic, Coptic, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic** (aii, arb, cop) in our database: **No clusivity**

#### Most Papuan Languages

Despite proximity to Austronesian, **Papuan languages rarely show clusivity** {wikipedia-clusivity-2025}.

**Trans-New Guinea family** (200+ languages in our database): Mostly absent (suspected)

## 4. Root/Bridge Languages for Bible Translation

### Definition
A "root language" is a source language translators commonly use as their starting point, prioritizing Hebrew/Greek but often using regional dominant languages.

### Clusivity Status of Major Root Languages

| Language | ISO-639-3 | Family | Clusivity | Role |
|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|------|
| **Hebrew** | heb | Afro-Asiatic | **ABSENT** | Original OT |
| **Greek** (Koine/Modern) | grc/ell | Indo-European | **ABSENT** | Original NT |
| **Latin** | lat | Indo-European | **ABSENT** | Historical bridge |
| **English** | eng | Indo-European | **ABSENT** | Global bridge |
| **Spanish** | spa | Indo-European | **ABSENT** | Latin America bridge |
| **French** | fra | Indo-European | **ABSENT** | Africa bridge |
| **Arabic** | arb | Afro-Asiatic | **ABSENT** | Middle East bridge |
| **Swahili** | swa | Niger-Congo | **ABSENT** (suspected) | East Africa bridge |
| **Indonesian/Malay** | ind/zlm | Austronesian | **MANDATORY** | SE Asia bridge ✅ |
| **Mandarin Chinese** | cmn | Sino-Tibetan | **OPTIONAL** | East Asia bridge ⚠️ |

**Key Finding**: Of the 10 major root languages, **only Indonesian/Malay REQUIRES clusivity**, and Mandarin optionally marks it. All others lack the distinction entirely.

**Translation Challenge**: When translating from non-clusivity languages (Hebrew/Greek/English) into clusivity-required languages (Austronesian, Australian, Dravidian), translators must infer clusivity from **context alone**.

## 6. Candidate Languages for Translation Database (Stage 2)

**Criteria**:
1. Mix of clusivity-marking vs non-marking
2. Diverse language families
3. Availability in our translation database
4. Theological/geographical significance

### Recommended 10 Languages

| # | Language | ISO | Family | Clusivity | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Tagalog** | tgl | Austronesian | **Mandatory** | Large speaker base, clear incl/excl distinction, Philippines |
| 2 | **Malay** | zlm | Austronesian | **Mandatory** | Bridge language for Indonesia/Malaysia, 200M+ speakers |
| 3 | **Mandarin Chinese** | cmn | Sino-Tibetan | **Optional** | 1B+ speakers, optionally marks clusivity (zánmen vs wǒmen) |
| 4 | **English** | eng | Indo-European | **Absent** | Global bridge language, no clusivity |
| 5 | **Spanish** | spa | Indo-European | **Absent** | Latin America bridge, no clusivity |
| 6 | **Cebuano** | ceb | Austronesian | **Mandatory** | Philippines, similar to Tagalog |
| 7 | **Arrernte (Eastern)** | aer | Australian | **Mandatory (dual)** | Australian Aboriginal, marks clusivity in dual number |
| 8 | **Fijian** | fij | Austronesian | **Mandatory** | Pacific, trial/dual distinctions |
| 9 | **Vietnamese** | vie | Austroasiatic | **Mandatory** (suspected) | SE Asia, 80M+ speakers, *chúng ta* (incl) vs *chúng tôi* (excl) |
| 10 | **Chuukese** | chk | Austronesian | **Mandatory** | Micronesian, full Bible available |

**Alternative candidates**:
- Chamorro (cha) - Micronesian Austronesian
- Chin languages (cek, csy, cth) - Sino-Tibetan, Myanmar
- Enga (enq) - Trans-New Guinea (verify if has clusivity)

---

## 7. Cultural & Social Nuances

### Honorifics Interaction

In some languages, **clusivity interacts with social register**:

**Vietnamese** {medium-clusivity-2025}:
- *ta* (familiar "I") → *chúng ta* (inclusive we)
- *tôi* (formal "I") → *chúng tôi* (exclusive we)
- The formality level of the singular pronoun carries into the plural

**Japanese/Korean**: No clusivity distinction, but **elaborate honorific systems** affect person reference
- Not a clusivity issue, but affects how "we" is expressed

### Theological/Cultural Sensitivity

**The Lord's Prayer Error** {tips-translation-bible-2025}:
- Early missionaries in Kwara'ae used **inclusive "we"** in "Forgive us our trespasses"
- This implied **God shares in human sin** (God + us sinned)
- Had to be corrected to **exclusive "we"** (we humans sinned, not you God)

**Implication**: Getting clusivity wrong can create **heresy**, not just awkwardness.

## 8. Typological Classifications for Selected Languages

### Austronesian Languages (Mandatory Clusivity)

**Tagalog** (tgl):
- **Status**: Mandatory
- **Forms**: *tayo* (1PL.INCL) vs *kami* (1PL.EXCL)
- **Number interaction**: Singular *ako* (1SG) → Plural splits into two forms
- **Dual**: Not distinguished (only singular vs plural)

**Malay/Indonesian** (zlm/ind):
- **Status**: Mandatory (but *kami* declining in colloquial use)
- **Forms**: *kita* (1PL.INCL) vs *kami* (1PL.EXCL)
- **Sociolinguistic note**: *kita* increasingly used for both functions in informal speech {medium-clusivity-2025}

**Fijian** (fij):
- **Status**: Mandatory across all plural numbers
- **Number interaction**: Distinguishes singular, dual, trial, plural
- **Forms**: All plural numbers (dual, trial, paucal, plural) distinguish inclusive vs exclusive
- **Example**: Trial inclusive (exactly 3, including you) vs trial exclusive (exactly 3, not including you)

### Australian Languages (Mandatory in Dual)

**Arrernte** (aer):
- **Status**: Mandatory in dual number, extends to plural
- **Forms**:
  - Dual inclusive: *ngali* (we two, including you)
  - Dual exclusive: *ngaliju* (we two, not including you)
- **Typological note**: Dual clusivity is **more common** than plural clusivity in Australian languages {wals-clusivity-2025}

### Sino-Tibetan (Optional/Contextual)

**Mandarin Chinese** (cmn):
- **Status**: Optional (not grammatically required)
- **Forms**:
  - Inclusive: 咱们 *zánmen* (you and I and possibly others)
  - Ambiguous: 我们 *wǒmen* (we - may or may not include addressee)
- **Usage**: *Zánmen* is **explicitly inclusive**, *wǒmen* is **neutral/ambiguous**, NOT strictly exclusive
- **Historical**: Borrowed from Altaic substrate after late Tang dynasty {languagelog-clusivity-2025}

**Chin languages** (cek, csy, cth - Sino-Tibetan, Myanmar):
- **Status**: Mandatory (suspected based on Tibeto-Burman typology)
- **Requires verification** from grammars

### Indo-European (Absent)

**English** (eng):
- **Status**: Absent
- **Form**: *we* is ambiguous (covers both inclusive and exclusive meanings)
- **Semantic options**: Can use *we* (speaker + others) vs *you and I* (explicitly inclusive), but not grammaticalized

**Spanish** (spa):
- **Status**: Absent
- **Form**: *nosotros/nosotras* (we.MASC/we.FEM) - gender-marked but no clusivity

| **Trans-New Guinea** (mostly absent) | ~200+ | ~20% |
| **Niger-Congo** (absent) | ~50 | ~5% |
| **Other families** | ~200 | ~20% |

**Estimate**: ~30-35% of languages in our database REQUIRE clusivity marking, aligning with global prevalence of 31.5% {wals-clusivity-2025}.

---

## 10. Gaps & Further Research Needed

1. **Trans-New Guinea family**: Verify clusivity status (200+ languages in database)
2. **Mayan languages**: Check if any mark clusivity (~20 in database)
3. **Dravidian**: No languages in current database - consider adding Tamil/Telugu
4. **Algonquian**: Only 2 languages in database (Algonquin, Blackfoot) - verify clusivity + check for **obviation** (proximate/obviative "fourth person")
5. **Vietnamese**: Verify clusivity status (suspected mandatory based on web research, but no grammar consulted)
6. **Dual vs Plural**: Which languages mark clusivity ONLY in dual vs across all plural numbers?
7. **Trial/Paucal**: How does clusivity interact with trial/paucal numbers in Austronesian?
