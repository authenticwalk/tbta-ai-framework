  # ========== TRINITY REFERENCES (HIGHEST STAKES) ==========

  - verse_pattern: 'Gen 1:26 - "Let us make man in our image" (unverified)'
    affected_values: [First Inclusive, Third]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Trinity (nature of God)
      - Creation theology
      - Imago Dei

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Choice affects core doctrine. Hebrew uses 1st person plural ("let us... our image"),
      but does not mark clusivity. Translation into clusivity-marking languages requires
      choosing who "us" includes:
      - First Inclusive + Trial Number = Trinity (God addresses Godself - 3 Persons)
      - Third Person (+ angels/council) = Divine Council interpretation
      Person choice determines whether Trinity or alternative interpretation.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: First Inclusive # God speaks within Godhead
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Second] # Would imply God addresses humans (who don't create)
      theological_basis: 'God is One Essence, Three Persons. "Us" is intra-Trinitarian deliberation.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Use First Inclusive (if language has trial number, use Trial Inclusive).
        - RATIONALE: God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) deliberate together as one God.
        - AVOID: Third person (angels/divine council - violates "God alone creates").
        - FORBIDDEN: Second person (would include humans in creation).

      - Knowledge of good and evil

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Similar to Gen 1:26. God says man "has become like one of us, knowing good and evil."
      Person choice determines Trinity vs divine council interpretation.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: First Inclusive
      acceptable_alternatives: []

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      God uses singular "I" then plural "us" in same verse.
      Classic Trinitarian proof text (singular essence, plural persons).
      Person choice affects Trinity interpretation.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: First Inclusive
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Second] # God is not asking Isaiah to send
      theological_basis: 'Trinity deliberation. Singular/plural shift shows one God, multiple Persons.'

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:

      - Indwelling of God

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Jesus says "My Father will love him, and we will come to him."
      "We" = Father and Son (and implicitly Holy Spirit in context).
      Clusivity choice determines whether Spirit is included in "we."

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: First Inclusive # Father, Son, (Holy Spirit)
      acceptable_alternatives: [First Exclusive] # Father and Son, assuming Spirit separate mention
      forbidden_values: [Second, Third]
      theological_basis: 'Trinity indwells believers. "We" = Godhead (or Father + Son if Spirit mentioned separately in v. 26).'

    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Sinlessness of God
      - Nature of prayer
      - Doctrine of sin

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "Forgive us our trespasses/sins/debts" must use EXCLUSIVE "we" (excluding God).
      Inclusive would imply God shares in human sin - HERETICAL.
      Early missionaries made this error in Kwara'ae, had to correct it.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: First Exclusive
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [First Inclusive]
      theological_basis: 'God is sinless. "Us" = we humans, NOT you God. God forgives, does not need forgiveness.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - MANDATORY: Use First Exclusive (we humans, not you God).
        - FORBIDDEN: First Inclusive would imply God sins (heresy).
        - HISTORICAL ERROR: Kwara'ae early translation used inclusive = "Forgive us (yours and ours) our sins."

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Inclusive "we" (God included in sin)'
        used_by: [Early missionary translation errors]

      - Corporate sin

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Daniel prays on behalf of Israel, confessing "we have sinned."
      If language marks clusivity, must exclude God from "we."

    affected_doctrines:
      - Confession of sin
      - God's faithfulness vs human sin

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Explicit contrast: God = faithful; we = wicked.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: First Exclusive
      acceptable_alternatives: []

    affected_doctrines:
      - Apostolic authority
      - Church governance
      - Ecclesiastical decisions

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Apostles/elders write to Gentile churches: "It seemed good to us."
      "Us" = council members, NOT recipients (who did not participate in decision).
      Inclusive would wrongly imply Gentile participation in council decision.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: First Exclusive
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [First Inclusive]
      theological_basis: 'Council made decision FOR churches, not WITH them. Apostolic authority.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Use First Exclusive (we apostles/elders, not you Gentile believers).
        - Inclusive would undermine apostolic authority (implying recipients made decision).

      acceptable_alternatives: [Third] # "All" (3rd person) is also used
      forbidden_values: []
      theological_basis: 'Universal sinfulness. Paul includes himself and readers: all are sinners.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Inclusive "we" includes Paul + readers + all humanity.
        - Emphasizes Paul's humility (not excluding himself from sinners).
        - Exceptions: Jesus (sinless), possibly infants before age of accountability (debated).

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Paul speaks of believers' resurrection: "We shall all be changed."
      "We" = believers only (Paul + Corinthian Christians), NOT all humanity.
      EXCLUSIVE of unbelievers (whose resurrection is separate: John 5:28-29).

      forbidden_values: []
      theological_basis: 'Even apostles are sinners needing confession. "We" includes John + readers.'
      translator_guidance: |
        - Inclusive "we" counters pride/perfectionism.
        - John does not exclude himself from needing confession.

# SECTION 2: AMBIGUOUS CONTEXTS (Exegetically Debated)
# These contexts have legitimate scholarly disagreement on clusivity

ambiguous_contexts:

  - verse_pattern: 'Gal 2:15 - "We ourselves are Jews by birth, not Gentile sinners" (unverified)'
    rationale: |
      Ambiguous whether Paul continues addressing Peter (Acts 15 incident) or shifts to addressing
      Galatian audience. If addressing Peter: INCLUSIVE (includes Peter). If addressing Galatians:
      EXCLUSIVE (Paul + Jewish Christians, not Gentile Galatians).
      Greek text does not clarify. Scholars disagree.
    scholarly_positions:
      - Pickett & Cowan (1962): Recommend Inclusive
      - SIL International (1999): Recommend Exclusive (but note uncertainty)
    estimated_percentage: 5% # Small percentage of verses have exegetical ambiguity

  - verse_pattern: '1 Cor 1:1 - "Paul... and Sosthenes" writing "to the church" (unverified)'
    rationale: |
      Ambiguous whether "we/our" in the letter includes readers or just Paul + Sosthenes.

# Most "we" contexts are stylistically flexible

arbitrary_contexts:

  - pattern: "Narrative travel companions (e.g., 'We sailed to...', Acts 'we-passages')"
    rationale: 'Referent clear from context; clusivity is stylistic choice (traveling group).'
    estimated_percentage: 30%

  - pattern: "Generic humanity (e.g., 'We reap what we sow', proverbial wisdom)"
    rationale: 'Generic "we" = people in general. Clusivity less important (universal principle).'
    estimated_percentage: 20%

  - pattern: "Crowd sizes, groups of people (e.g., 'multitude', 'all of us')"
    rationale: 'Exact participant composition less theologically significant.'
    estimated_percentage: 25%

  - pattern: "Routine speech acts (e.g., 'We said', 'We went')"
    rationale: 'Context clarifies participants; clusivity is stylistic.'

  high_stakes_count: ~10 # Trinity, prayers excluding God, critical apostolic authority
  medium_stakes_count: ~15 # Apostolic authority, resurrections, confessions
  low_stakes_count: ~20 # Routine exhortations, apostolic references

# SECTION 5: TRANSLATION BEST PRACTICES

translation_best_practices:
  - practice: 'For Trinity references (Gen 1:26, etc.), consistently use First Inclusive to maintain orthodox Christology.'
  - practice: 'For prayers confessing sin, ALWAYS use First Exclusive (exclude God from human sin).'
  - practice: 'For apostolic letters, distinguish: decisions BY apostles = Exclusive; exhortations TO believers = Inclusive.'
  - practice: 'For ambiguous contexts (Gal 2:15), document choice in translator notes and maintain consistency within book.'
  - practice: 'For narrative "we-passages" (Acts), use context to determine participant boundaries (author + companions).'
