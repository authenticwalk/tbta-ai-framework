non_arbitrary_contexts:

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1A. NON-ARBITRARY-THEOLOGICAL: Affects Doctrine
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'God\'s attributes - superlative exclusivity (unverified)'
    example_verses:
      - 'Psalm 145:3 - "Great is the LORD and most worthy of praise"'
      - 'Psalm 48:1 - "Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised"'
      - 'Isaiah 12:6 - "Great is the Holy One of Israel among you"'
    affected_values: [superlative, elative, intensified, extremely_intensified]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Monotheism (God's unique supremacy)
      - Divine Attributes (immutability, perfection)
      - Worship (God alone worthy of ultimate praise)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      God's attributes are ABSOLUTE, not comparative. Using proper superlative/
      elative distinguishes God's unique supremacy from created beings.
      - Comparative ("God is greater than X") implies limited comparison
      - Superlative ("God is the greatest") establishes absolute supremacy
      - Elative ("God is very great") emphasizes intensity without comparison

      Theological risk: Weak degree (positive/comparative) may understate God's
      absolute perfection, suggesting God is merely "better" than others rather
      than categorically supreme.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: superlative  # or elative
      acceptable_alternatives: [elative, extremely_intensified]
      forbidden_values: [positive, comparative]  # Too weak for God's attributes
      theological_basis: |
        God is the summum bonum (highest good), not merely better than others.
        Aseity (self-existence) and divine simplicity require absolute, not
        relative, attributes.

      translator_guidance: |
        - FIRST CHOICE: Superlative if language has it ("greatest", "most holy")
        - SECOND CHOICE: Elative/intensified if superlative unavailable ("very great")
        - AVOID: Bare positive ("God is great") without intensification
        - AVOID: Comparative unless explicit comparison in context ("greater than idols")

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Henotheism (God is greatest among gods)'
        used_by: [Ancient Near Eastern polytheism, Mormon/LDS]

  - verse_pattern: 'Christ\'s superiority to angels/creation (unverified)'
    example_verses:
      - 'Hebrews 1:4 - "having become as much superior to angels"'
      - 'Philippians 2:9 - "the name which is above every name"'
      - 'Colossians 1:15 - "the firstborn over all creation"'
    affected_values: [comparative, superlative]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christology (deity of Christ)
      - Creation theology (Christ as Creator, not created)
      - Soteriology (only divine Savior can redeem)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Christ's superiority to angels/creation is CATEGORICAL (deity vs. creation),
      not merely GRADATIONAL (better creature). Degree choice affects whether
      Christ is presented as:
      - COMPARATIVE: Better than angels (but still created? - Arianism)
      - SUPERLATIVE: Highest/supreme over all (divine status)

      Hebrews 1:4 uses comparative κρείττων (kreittōn "superior/better"), but
      context establishes categorical difference (Son vs. servants, Creator vs.
      created). Degree must capture ontological distinction, not just excellence.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: superlative
      acceptable_alternatives: [comparative_with_categorical_sense]
      forbidden_values: []  # Comparative acceptable if context clarifies deity
      theological_basis: |
        Nicene Creed: "God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God."
        Christ is not the best creature, but God incarnate. Superiority is
        ontological (different kind of being), not gradational (better version
        of same kind).

      translator_guidance: |
        - PRIORITY: Capture categorical superiority, not just gradational
        - If comparative form in Greek, ensure context makes divine status clear
        - Avoid: Translations suggesting Christ is merely highest angel/creature
        - Key verses: Hebrews 1:4 (superior), Colossians 1:15-18 (supremacy)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Arianism (Christ is highest created being)'
        used_by: [Jehovah\'s Witnesses, ancient Arianism]
        christian_assessment: HERETICAL (Nicaea 325 AD condemned this)

      - interpretation: 'Adoptionism (Jesus became divine)'
        used_by: [Early heresies, some liberal theology]
        christian_assessment: HERETICAL (Denies eternal deity)

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'Greatest commandment - priority, not absolute value (unverified)'
    example_verses:
      - 'Matthew 22:36-38 - "the greatest commandment in the Law"'
      - 'Mark 12:28-31 - "which is the most important?"'
    affected_values: [superlative, positive]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Ethics (moral priority)
      - Hermeneutics (interpretive principle)
      - Practical theology (discipleship)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "Greatest commandment" is about PRIORITY (first importance), not EXCLUSIVITY
      (only important). Greek uses positive adjective μεγάλη (megalē "great") with
      superlative sense contextually. Translation affects:
      - Does "greatest" mean "most important" (priority)?
      - Or "only important" (exclusivity)?
      - Or "big commandment" (neutral)?

      Theological issue: Jesus ranks commandments (love God > love neighbor),
      establishing hermeneutical priority. Weak degree ("great commandment")
      loses ranking function.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: superlative  # "greatest" captures priority
      acceptable_alternatives: [positive_with_contextual_superlative_sense]
      forbidden_values: []  # Positive acceptable if context clear
      theological_basis: |
        Jesus establishes hierarchy: Love God (first/greatest), love neighbor
        (second, "like" the first). Not all commandments equal weight.

      translator_guidance: |
        - PREFERRED: "Greatest commandment" (explicit ranking)
        - ACCEPTABLE: "Great commandment" if context shows comparison
        - CLARIFY: "First/most important" if superlative unavailable
        - AVOID: Implying all commandments are equally important (relativism)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'All commandments equally important'
        used_by: [Some liberal theology, moral relativism]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED (Jesus explicitly ranks them)

  # 1B. NON-ARBITRARY-CONTEXTUAL: Reader Understanding (Not Heresy, But Confusing)
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'Comparative with explicit standard - preserves logic (unverified)'
    example_verses:
      - '1 Samuel 15:22 - "To obey is better than sacrifice"'
      - 'Matthew 6:25 - "Is not life more than food?"'
      - 'John 14:28 - "The Father is greater than I"'
    affected_values: [comparative, positive]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Ethics (value hierarchies)
      - Trinitarian theology (John 14:28 - economic Trinity)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      When source text has EXPLICIT comparison ("X is better than Y"), translating
      as positive ("X is good") loses logical structure. Reader cannot understand
      the ranking/contrast.

      Example: "To obey is good" (positive) ≠ "To obey is better than sacrifice"
      (comparative). First is generic praise; second is value hierarchy.

      Contextual confusion: Without comparative, reader misses that obedience >
      sacrifice in God's priorities.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: comparative
      acceptable_alternatives: [periphrastic_comparative]  # "more good than"
      forbidden_values: [positive]  # Loses comparison
      theological_basis: |
        Scripture establishes value hierarchies (mercy > sacrifice, obedience >
        ritual, love > knowledge). Comparative degree preserves these rankings.

      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Preserve comparative when explicit standard present
        - If no comparative form: Use periphrastic ("more X than Y")
        - AVOID: Reducing to positive; obscures scriptural priority

  - verse_pattern: 'Least/last in kingdom - paradox of reversal (unverified)'
    example_verses:
      - 'Matthew 25:40,45 - "the least of these my brothers"'
      - 'Matthew 18:4 - "Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest"'
      - 'Luke 9:48 - "he who is least among you all is the one who is great"'
    affected_values: [superlative, least, comparative]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Kingdom ethics (reversal of worldly values)
      - Christology (Christ identifies with marginalized)
      - Ecclesiology (servant leadership)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Jesus' teaching on "least" and "greatest" creates theological paradox:
      - Worldly "greatest" = Kingdom "least"
      - Worldly "least" = Kingdom "greatest"

      Using wrong degree obscures paradox:
      - "Small people" (positive) ≠ "the least" (superlative minimum)
      - "A child" (indefinite) ≠ "the least among you" (superlative comparison)

      Reader impact: Misses Jesus' radical reversal of status/honor systems.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: superlative_least  # "the least", "the greatest"
      acceptable_alternatives: [inverse_superlative]  # "smallest", "lowest"
      forbidden_values: [positive_without_superlative_sense]
      theological_basis: |
        Jesus inverts worldly hierarchies (Mark 10:43-44). "Least" and "greatest"
        are polar opposites; softening to "small" and "big" loses radical edge.

      translator_guidance: |
        - PRESERVE: Superlative extremes ("least", "greatest")
        - CLARIFY: These are inversions (least becomes greatest)
        - AVOID: Softening to comparative/positive (loses paradox)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness: []  # Ethical teaching, not doctrinal dispute

  - verse_pattern: 'Blessing superlatives - unique status (unverified)'
    example_verses:
      - 'Luke 1:42 - "Blessed are you among women" (Mary)'
      - 'Genesis 12:2 - "I will make you... a great nation"'
    affected_values: [superlative, elative, positive]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Mariology (Mary's unique role - contested across denominations)
      - Election theology (God's chosen people/individuals)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "Blessed among women" (Luke 1:42) can be translated as:
      - Superlative: "Most blessed of all women" (unique status)
      - Elative: "Very blessed among women" (highly favored, but not exclusive)
      - Positive: "You are blessed among women" (one of many blessed)

      Denominational sensitivity:
      - Roman Catholic: Prefers superlative (Mary as uniquely blessed)
      - Protestant: Prefers elative/positive (Mary highly favored, not uniquely so)

      Translation affects Marian theology without changing core gospel.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: elative_or_superlative  # Both acceptable
      acceptable_alternatives: [superlative, elative, positive_with_honor]
      forbidden_values: []  # All main traditions accept blessing
      theological_basis: |
        All Christians affirm Mary's blessedness (mother of Jesus). Debate is
        DEGREE of honor (Hyperdulia vs. deep respect). Translation reflects but
        doesn't determine denominational stance.

      translator_guidance: |
        - CATHOLIC PREFERENCE: "Most blessed" (superlative)
        - PROTESTANT PREFERENCE: "Highly favored/blessed" (elative)
        - AVOID: Minimizing Mary's honor (dishonors Scripture)
        - AVOID: Excessive honor beyond biblical text (avoid accretions)

    denominational_considerations_within_christianity:
      - denomination: Roman Catholic
        preferred_degree: superlative
        rationale: 'Mary as Theotokos (God-bearer), unique among women'

      - denomination: Protestant (Evangelical/Reformed)
        preferred_degree: elative
        rationale: 'Mary highly honored but not worshiped; avoid hyperdulia'

      - denomination: Eastern Orthodox
        preferred_degree: superlative
        rationale: 'Mary as Panagia (All-Holy), greatest saint'

# ==============================================================================

arbitrary_contexts:

  - pattern: 'General descriptions - crowd sizes, travel distances (unverified)'
    examples:
      - 'Large crowd (vs. very large crowd vs. enormous crowd)'
      - 'Long journey (vs. longer vs. longest)'
      - 'High mountain (vs. very high vs. highest)'
    rationale: |
      Exact degree of size/distance/height is stylistically chosen by translator,
      not theologically determined. "Large crowd" vs. "very large crowd" affects
      narrative vividness but not doctrine or reader comprehension.
    estimated_percentage: 75%

  - pattern: 'Comparisons without theological weight (unverified)'
    examples:
      - 'Older brother vs. younger brother (age comparison)'
      - 'Richer vs. poorer (wealth comparison)'
      - 'Stronger vs. weaker (physical strength)'
    rationale: |
      Factual comparisons (age, wealth, strength) are semantically necessary
      (comparative degree preserves fact), but WHICH degree word is arbitrary
      ("older" vs. "more advanced in years").
    estimated_percentage: 15%

  - pattern: 'Intensification for emphasis - stylistic choice (unverified)'
    examples:
      - 'Very happy vs. extremely happy vs. overjoyed'
      - 'Quite sad vs. very sad vs. deeply grieved'
      - 'Somewhat angry vs. very angry vs. furious'
    rationale: |
      Intensification strength (Intensified vs. Extremely Intensified) is often
      translator's stylistic choice to match source language register/emphasis.
      Biblical text: χαρᾷ μεγάλῃ (chara megalē "great joy") - how intensified?
      Options: "great joy", "very great joy", "exceedingly great joy" - all valid.
    estimated_percentage: 8%

  - pattern: 'Poetic/prophetic language - literary style (unverified)'
    examples:
      - 'Highest heavens (poetic intensification)'
      - 'Deepest depths (poetic extremes)'
      - 'Darkest darkness (prophetic imagery)'
    rationale: |
      Poetic/prophetic texts use degree for literary effect. Translator balances
      literal rendering vs. target language poetic conventions. Choice is literary,
      not theological.

  highest_theological_stakes: 'God\'s attributes, Christology, Kingdom ethics'

guidance_for_algorithm:
  critical_contexts: |
    - God's attributes: ALWAYS use superlative/elative (never bare positive)
    - Christ's superiority: Ensure categorical sense preserved
    - Explicit comparisons: MUST preserve comparative degree
    - "Least" and "greatest" paradoxes: Preserve superlative extremes

  arbitrary_contexts: |
    - General descriptions: Follow source degree, but translation can adjust
    - Intensification: Match source register, but exact strength is flexible
    - Poetic language: Balance literalism with target poetic norms

    - 'Luke 1:42 - Mary\'s blessedness (Catholic vs. Protestant degree preference)'
    - 'John 14:28 - "Father is greater than I" (Trinitarian debates)'

  guidance: |
    For contested verses, note denominational preferences but do not force one
    interpretation. Multi-denominational projects should provide notes explaining
    valid alternatives within Christian orthodoxy.

# ==============================================================================
# NOTES & METHODOLOGY
# ==============================================================================

methodology_notes: |
  This classification is based on:
  1. Internal knowledge of Scripture (marked "unverified" per instructions)
  2. Theological analysis of where degree affects doctrine/interpretation
  3. Conservative Protestant orthodox perspective as primary framework
  4. Denominational variations noted within Christian orthodoxy
  5. Non-orthodox views (cults, other religions) flagged as rejected

  All verses are (unverified) - Stage 2 research will validate with concordances,
  commentaries, and actual Bible translation examples.

future_validation_needed:
  - 'Concordance search for all degree-marked words in Greek/Hebrew'
  - 'Commentary review for verses where degree is exegetically debated'
  - 'Translation comparison across 10 languages for contested verses'
  - 'Theological expert review (Trinity, Christology, Mariology)'
