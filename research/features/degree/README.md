# Stage 1 Research Summary: Degree

**Feature**: Degree (Comparison & Intensification)
**Completion Date**: 2025-11-29
**Status**: Stage 1 Research Complete - Ready for Stage 2

## What is Degree?

**Definition**: Degree is a grammatical feature marking:
1. **Comparison** (comparative, superlative, equative)
2. **Intensification** (intensified, extremely intensified, elative)
3. **Inverse forms** (less, least)

**Core Values**: Positive (base) → Comparative (more X) → Superlative (most X)
**Extended Values**: Intensified (very X), Extremely Intensified, 'too' X, Equative (as X as), Inverse (less/least X)

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Source Language Asymmetry** (TBTA.md, LANGUAGES.md)
   - **Greek**: EXPLICIT morphology (-τερος/-τατος) but semantic function is CONTEXT-DEPENDENT
   - **Hebrew**: NO morphology; all degree INFERRED from syntax (מִן, construct state)
   - **Implication**: OT and NT require DIFFERENT prediction strategies

2. **Morphological Universals** (SCHOLARLY.md)
   - Bobaljik's Containment Hypothesis: Superlative CONTAINS comparative (300+ languages)
   - *ABA Constraint: If comparative suppletive, superlative MUST be (good-better-best, not *good-better-goodest)
   - Cross-linguistic: Suppletive forms (good/better/best) follow universal patterns

3. **Typological Diversity** (LANGUAGES.md)
   - **4 Major Comparative Types**: Exceed, Particle, Conjoined, Locational (WALS)
   - **70% of corpus**: Languages with MANDATORY degree marking (morphological or analytic)
   - **30% of corpus**: Languages with OPTIONAL degree (contextual comparison)

4. **Theological Significance** (THEOLOGICALLY-SIGNIFICANT-GROUPS.yaml)
   - **~15-20% Non-Arbitrary**: God's attributes, Christology, kingdom paradoxes
   - **~80-85% Arbitrary**: Stylistic choices (crowd sizes, general descriptions)
   - **High Stakes**: Superlatives for God (monotheism), Christ's superiority (Christology)

5. **TBTA Data** (TBTA.md)
   - **30,879 annotations**: 11 distinct degree values
   - **93.8% "No Degree"**: Most constituents don't take degree
   - **Productive values**: Intensified (2.7%), Comparative (1.3%), Superlative (0.9%)
   - **Rare values**: Equative (0.1%), 'less'/'least' (0.2%), mixed annotations

### 2. LANGUAGES.md - Language Family & Typology Analysis (575 lines)

**What it covers**:
- 10 language families analyzed (Indo-European, Austronesian, Niger-Congo, Sino-Tibetan, etc.)
- Morphological vs. analytic vs. periphrastic degree systems
- 10 proposed languages for Translation Database (Stage 2)

1. English (morphological + analytic)
2. Spanish (analytic: más/menos)
3. Mandarin (particles: 更/最)
4. Arabic (elative af'al pattern)
5. Indonesian (analytic: lebih/paling)
6. Swahili (analytic: zaidi)
7. Russian (morphological inflection)

### 3. SCHOLARLY.md - Scholarly Research (920+ lines)

**What it covers**:
- 29 scholarly sources (morphology, semantics, typology, biblical linguistics)
- Bobaljik (2012): Universals in Comparative Morphology
- Kennedy & McNally (2005): Scale Structure and Degree Semantics
- Stassen (1985, 2013): WALS Comparative Constructions typology
- Biblical languages: Greek/Hebrew degree systems, translation case studies

**Major Scholarly Frameworks**:
1. **Bobaljik's Containment Hypothesis**: Superlative = [[comparative] superlative]
2. **Kennedy's Scale Semantics**: Open scales (tall) vs. closed scales (full)
3. **Stassen's Typology**: 4 comparative construction types (WALS 121)
4. **Beck's DSP**: Languages with/without degrees in ontology

**Translation Case Studies**:
- Matthew 22:36: "Greatest commandment" (Greek positive form, superlative function)
- Song of Songs 1:1: "Song of songs" (Hebrew superlative construction)
- Fuyug (Papua New Guinea): No superlative available, uses positive + sequential order

### 4. THEOLOGICALLY-SIGNIFICANT-GROUPS.yaml - Theological Classification (350+ lines)

**What it covers**:
- Non-arbitrary contexts (15-20%): Where degree affects doctrine/interpretation
- Arbitrary contexts (80-85%): Where degree is stylistic
- Denominational considerations (Catholic vs. Protestant preferences)

**Non-Arbitrary Theological** (High Stakes):
1. **God's Attributes**: Superlative/elative REQUIRED (monotheism, divine supremacy)
   - Forbidden: Bare positive/comparative (too weak)
   - Example: "Great is the LORD" should be "Greatest" or "Very great"

2. **Christ's Superiority**: Categorical, not gradational (Christology)
   - Hebrews 1:4 "superior to angels" - deity, not just excellence
   - Forbidden: Implying Christ is best creature (Arianism)

3. **Greatest Commandment**: Priority ranking (hermeneutical principle)
   - Matthew 22:36 - superlative captures ranking function

**Non-Arbitrary Contextual** (Reader Confusion):
4. **Explicit Comparisons**: Must preserve comparative logic ("obey is better than sacrifice")
5. **Least/Greatest Paradoxes**: Superlative extremes essential (kingdom reversal)
6. **Blessing Superlatives**: Denominational sensitivity (Mary's blessedness)

**Arbitrary Contexts** (75-85%):
- Crowd sizes, travel distances, general descriptions
- Intensification strength (very vs. extremely)
- Poetic/prophetic literary style

**Link**: [THEOLOGICALLY-SIGNIFICANT-GROUPS.yaml](./THEOLOGICALLY-SIGNIFICANT-GROUPS.yaml)

## Cross-Document Synthesis

### Agreement Across Sources

1. **Greek has morphology, Hebrew doesn't** (TBTA.md, LANGUAGES.md, SCHOLARLY.md all agree)
2. **Superlative is rare in NT Greek** (TBTA.md, SCHOLARLY.md both note this)
3. **Most degree choices are arbitrary** (THEOLOGICALLY-SIGNIFICANT-GROUPS.yaml: 80-85%)
4. **Morphology ≠ Semantics** (all documents note Greek comparative can be superlative/elative)

### Discrepancies & Tensions

**Discrepancy 1**: TBTA vs. Linguistic Research on Elative
- **TBTA**: Lists "Intensified" and "Extremely Intensified" as separate values
- **SCHOLARLY.md**: Elative is traditional fourth degree (absolute superlative)
- **Resolution**: TBTA's categories may capture elative under "Intensified"; needs validation

**Discrepancy 2**: Equative Frequency
- **TBTA Data**: Only 7 instances (0.1%) of "Equality"
- **LANGUAGES.md**: Equatives common cross-linguistically (as...as constructions)
- **Possible Explanation**: TBTA may not mark all equatives, or Biblical text genuinely rare in equatives

**Discrepancy 3**: Hebrew Degree Identification
- **TBTA.md**: Notes Hebrew uses periphrastic degree but doesn't document detection rules
- **SCHOLARLY.md**: Provides Hebrew degree strategies (מִן, construct) but notes high ambiguity
- **Gap**: Algorithm needs explicit rules for identifying Hebrew degree constructions

## Implications for Stage 2: Translation Database

### What Stage 2 Must Accomplish

1. **Validate Source Language Rules**:
   - Test Greek: Does morphology predict semantics? (comparative → comparative/superlative/elative?)
   - Test Hebrew: Can we reliably detect מִן comparatives and construct superlatives?

2. **Build Language Typology Database**:
   - Implement 10 proposed languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, etc.)
   - Document degree strategies for each (morphological, analytic, periphrastic)
   - Classify gradable adjectives by scale type (Kennedy's open/closed scales)

3. **Create Balanced Test Sets**:
   - 100+ verses per degree value (comparative, superlative, intensified, etc.)
   - Include non-arbitrary verses (God's attributes, Christology) + arbitrary (descriptions)
   - OT and NT proportional (test Hebrew and Greek separately)

4. **Generate Dual Outputs**:
   - **Answer sheets**: TBTA annotations (degree values)
   - **Question sheets**: 10 translations (how did translators handle each degree?)

### Open Questions for Stage 2

1. **Gradability**: Which Biblical adjectives are gradable? Need lexicon classification.
2. **Elative Detection**: How to distinguish elative ("very great") from superlative ("greatest")?
3. **Mixed Annotations**: What combinations are valid? (Intensified Comparative = 9 instances)
4. **Hebrew Ambiguity**: Can we achieve >80% accuracy on Hebrew degree inference?

   - Do 80%+ agree on degree value for given verse?
   - Where does disagreement occur? (ambiguous contexts)

3. **Validate Source Language Rules**:
   - Greek: Morphology → function mapping (comparative form → what semantic functions?)
   - Hebrew: Syntax → degree inference (מִן detection accuracy?)

4. **Develop Gradability Classification**:
   - Identify Biblical adjectives that can take degree
   - Test Kennedy's scale typology on Biblical vocabulary
