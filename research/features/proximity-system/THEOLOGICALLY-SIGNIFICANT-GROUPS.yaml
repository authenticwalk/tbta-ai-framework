non_arbitrary_contexts:

  # === TRINITARIAN REFERENCES ===

  - verse_pattern: 'Gen 1:26 (Trinity "Let us make man") (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Near Speaker and Listener, Near Speaker, Contextually Near with Focus]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Trinity (nature of God)
      - Creation theology
      - Divine plurality vs. monotheism

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "Let us make man in our image" - demonstrative proximity affects
      interpretation of divine council participants.
      - Near Speaker and Listener (N): God addressing other divine persons
      - Near Speaker (S): God referring to self + Trinity
      - Contextually Near with Focus (C): Emphatic reference to image previously mentioned

      Wrong demonstrative can:
      - Imply polytheism (multiple separate gods)
      - Suggest angels as co-creators (rejected by orthodoxy)
      - Obscure Trinitarian interpretation

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Near Speaker and Listener  # God + Trinity in unity
      acceptable_alternatives: [Near Speaker, Contextually Near with Focus]
      forbidden_values: []  # No forbidden proximity values per se
      theological_basis: |
        God is One Essence, Three Persons. The "us" refers to intra-Trinitarian
        dialogue. Proximity should reflect divine unity (Near Both/Near Speaker)
        rather than distant separation.
      translator_guidance: |
        - PREFERRED: Use demonstrative suggesting unity/closeness if language distinguishes
        - ACCEPTABLE: Contextual reference to prior mention of God's Spirit (Gen 1:2)
        - AVOID: Distant demonstratives (Remote) that imply separation of divine persons

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Divine Council (God + Angels create)'
        used_by: [Jewish non-Messianic, some Muslim interpretations]
        christian_assessment: |
          REJECTED - Angels do not create (Colossians 1:16 "all things created by Him").
          Proximity choice should not facilitate this interpretation.
      - interpretation: 'Plural of Majesty (Royal "we")'
        used_by: [Some Jewish commentators, Unitarian groups]
        christian_assessment: |
          INSUFFICIENT - While grammatically possible, Christian orthodoxy sees
          Trinitarian foreshadowing. Proximity choice should allow Trinitarian reading.
      - interpretation: 'Multiple Gods (Polytheism)'
        used_by: [Ancient Near Eastern polytheists, Mormon/LDS]
        christian_assessment: |
          HERETICAL - Violates monotheism (Deut 6:4). Distant proximity (Remote)
          might facilitate polytheistic misreading in some languages.

  # === CHRISTOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION ===

  - verse_pattern: 'John 1:29 "Behold the Lamb of God" (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Near Speaker, Near Listener, Remote Visible]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Christology (identification of Jesus)
      - Soteriology (Jesus as sacrificial Lamb)
      - Revelation (manifestation of Christ to world)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      John the Baptist pointing to Jesus. Physical proximity affects:
      - Immediacy of revelation
      - Accessibility of Christ
      - Relationship between witness (John) and Savior (Jesus)

      Wrong demonstrative can:
      - Make Jesus seem distant/unapproachable (over-use of Remote)
      - Confuse identification (if too ambiguous in person-oriented languages)

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Near Speaker  # Jesus approaching John
      acceptable_alternatives: [Remote Visible, Near Listener]
      forbidden_values: []
      theological_basis: |
        Jesus is approaching John but not yet in immediate proximity.
        Demonstrative should show Jesus is visible, identified, but walking toward.
        For person-oriented languages, "Near Listener" (那/sore in Japanese) often best.
      translator_guidance: |
        - CONTEXT: Jesus walking toward John and crowd
        - SPATIAL: Medium distance, visible, approaching
        - PERSON-ORIENTED LANGUAGES: Often "Near Listener" (between speaker and distant)
        - DISTANCE-ORIENTED LANGUAGES: Proximal-medial range
        - AVOID: Extremely distant demonstratives (makes Christ inaccessible)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Jesus as merely human teacher (not divine Lamb)'
        used_by: [Unitarian, some liberal theology]
        christian_assessment: |
          HERETICAL - Denies deity of Christ and substitutionary atonement.
          Proximity choice itself does not prevent this, but translation must
          preserve "Lamb of God" title clearly.

  # === RESURRECTION APPEARANCES ===

  - verse_pattern: 'Luke 24:39 "See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself" (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Near Speaker]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Resurrection (physical bodily resurrection)
      - Christology (nature of resurrected body)
      - Evidence of resurrection

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Jesus showing His hands and feet to disciples - IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY required.
      Body parts belong to speaker (Jesus), maximally proximal.

      Wrong demonstrative (Remote, Near Listener) could:
      - Imply Jesus is distant (contradicts "touch me and see")
      - Suggest vision/apparition rather than physical presence
      - Weaken evidence for bodily resurrection

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Near Speaker  # Hands are part of speaker's body
      acceptable_alternatives: []  # No alternatives - must be proximal to speaker
      forbidden_values: [Near Listener, Remote Visible, Remote out of Sight]
      theological_basis: |
        Physical, bodily resurrection of Christ is foundational (1 Cor 15:14).
        Jesus' hands and feet are HIS body parts, not separate objects.
        Demonstrative must reflect immediate, tactile proximity.
      translator_guidance: |
        - **CRITICAL**: Use maximally proximal demonstrative
        - Body parts always proximal to person
        - Some languages may omit demonstrative entirely (possessive sufficient)
        - **FORBIDDEN**: Any distant or medial demonstratives

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Spiritual resurrection only (no physical body)'
        used_by: [Gnosticism, some liberal theology, Jehovah's Witnesses]
        christian_assessment: |
          HERETICAL - Contradicts Luke 24:39 "flesh and bones."
          Proximal demonstrative supports physical presence interpretation.

  # === DIVINE PRESENCE AND PROXIMITY ===

  - verse_pattern: 'Exod 3:5 "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground" (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Near Speaker and Listener, Near Listener, Contextually Near]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Divine holiness
      - Sacred space
      - God's presence

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Moses at burning bush - "the place where you (Moses) are standing."
      Proximity marks sacred space around divine presence.

      Demonstrative choice affects:
      - Perceived extent of holy ground
      - Relationship between God and sacred space
      - Moses' position relative to holiness

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Near Listener  # Place where Moses stands
      acceptable_alternatives: [Near Speaker and Listener, Contextually Near]
      forbidden_values: [Remote Visible, Remote out of Sight]
      theological_basis: |
        Holy ground is under Moses' feet - immediate proximity to addressee.
        God speaking to Moses about Moses' location.
        Distant demonstrative contradicts "where you are standing."
      translator_guidance: |
        - SPATIAL FOCUS: Ground beneath Moses' feet
        - PERSON-ORIENTED: "Near you" (addressee)
        - DISTANCE-ORIENTED: Proximal
        - Context: Divine presence makes location holy

  # === TEMPORAL DEMONSTRATIVES WITH ESCHATOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE ===

  - verse_pattern: 'Heb 1:2 "in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son" (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Temporally Near]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Eschatology (last days theology)
      - Progressive revelation
      - Christology (Christ as final revelation)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "These last days" (proximal temporal) vs. "those days" (distal temporal).
      Proximity marks current era as eschatologically significant.

      Wrong demonstrative (Temporally Remote) could:
      - Imply Christ's coming is past, not ongoing relevance
      - Disconnect readers from eschatological urgency
      - Contradict "last days" as present reality

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Temporally Near
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Temporally Remote]
      theological_basis: |
        The "last days" began with Christ's first coming and continue until
        His return. "These days" (proximal) maintains present relevance.
      translator_guidance: |
        - **REQUIRED**: Proximal temporal demonstrative
        - Emphasizes present eschatological era
        - **FORBIDDEN**: Remote temporal (makes Christ's revelation seem past only)

  - verse_pattern: 'Gen 1:1 "In the beginning" (remote temporal) (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Temporally Remote]
    theological_stakes: LOW  # Contextual clarity, not doctrinal
    affected_doctrines:
      - Creation ex nihilo
      - Temporal framework

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      "In the beginning" refers to primordial time, before human history.
      Temporally remote demonstrative appropriate.

      Proximal demonstrative (Temporally Near) would:
      - Confuse timeline (makes creation seem recent)
      - Reduce sense of ancient origin

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Temporally Remote
      acceptable_alternatives: [Contextually Near]  # If introducing narrative
      forbidden_values: []
      theological_basis: |
        Creation predates human history - distant past from reader's perspective.
        Proximal demonstrative less natural, though not heretical.
      translator_guidance: |
        - PREFERRED: Temporally Remote demonstrative
        - Marks primordial time
        - Acceptable: Discourse demonstrative if opening narrative frame

  # === CONTEXTUAL CLARITY (HIGH STAKES FOR READER UNDERSTANDING) ===

  - verse_pattern: 'Acts 1:11 "This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven" (unverified)'
    affected_values: [Contextually Near with Focus, Contextually Near]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Ascension
      - Second Coming
      - Identity of returning Christ

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      Angels speaking to disciples immediately after Jesus' ascension.
      "This Jesus" (emphatic demonstrative) vs. "that Jesus" (distant).

      Demonstrative affects:
      - Emphasis on SAME Jesus will return
      - Connection between ascended Jesus and returning Christ
      - Immediacy of promise

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Contextually Near with Focus  # Emphatic: THIS Jesus
      acceptable_alternatives: [Contextually Near, Near Speaker]
      forbidden_values: [Remote Visible, Temporally Remote]
      theological_basis: |
        Emphasizes identity: the SAME Jesus who ascended will return.
        Not a different being or spiritual manifestation.
      translator_guidance: |
        - **EMPHASIS CRITICAL**: Use emphatic/focused demonstrative if available
        - Connects to immediately preceding ascension event
        - Refutes any notion of different Christ returning

# SECTION 2: ARBITRARY (Stylistic/Contextual Choices)

arbitrary_contexts:

  - pattern: "Narrative spatial descriptions without theological significance"
    examples:
      - "that mountain" (spatial reference in travel narrative)
      - "this town" (geographical marker)
      - "those days" (temporal marker in genealogy)
    rationale: |
      Most spatial and temporal demonstratives in narrative serve literary
      function without affecting doctrine. Translator can choose based on:
      - Natural language flow
      - Narrative perspective
      - Genre conventions
    estimated_percentage: 85%

  - pattern: "Anaphoric demonstratives in discourse"
    examples:
      - "For this reason" (discourse connective)
      - "such things" (referring to previous list)
      - "those who" (anaphoric pronoun)
    rationale: |
      Discourse demonstratives (C, c) generally stylistic unless marking
      critical doctrinal connection (see non-arbitrary cases above).
    estimated_percentage: 90%

  - pattern: "Everyday object references"
    examples:
      - "this bread" (Last Supper context - unless Eucharistic theology at stake)
      - "that cloak" (in narrative)
      - "these coins" (in parable)
    rationale: |
      Physical objects' proximity usually contextual, not doctrinal.
      Exception: Sacramental contexts where object has theological significance.
    estimated_percentage: 95%

  - pattern: "Parabolic illustrations"
    examples:
      - "this seed" in Parable of the Sower
      - "that servant" in parables of Kingdom
    rationale: |
      Parable demonstratives serve rhetorical function, rarely doctrinal.
      Focus on parable's teaching, not demonstrative choice.
    estimated_percentage: 98%

# SUMMARY STATISTICS

# TRANSLATOR GUIDELINES

translator_guidelines: |
  1. **Default Assumption**: Most proximity choices are ARBITRARY (stylistic)

  2. **High-Stakes Contexts** (Require careful review):
     - Trinitarian references (Gen 1:26, Matt 28:19)
     - Christological identifications (John 1:29, Acts 1:11)
     - Resurrection appearances (Luke 24:39, John 20:27)
     - Eschatological timeframes (Heb 1:2, 2 Peter 3:3)

  3. **Medium-Stakes Contexts** (Contextual clarity important):
     - Divine presence and sacred space (Exod 3:5)
     - Covenantal language ("this covenant")
     - Sacramental references (Last Supper, Baptism)

  4. **Arbitrary Contexts** (Translator freedom):
     - Narrative spatial markers (travel descriptions)
     - Everyday object references
     - Anaphoric discourse connectives
     - Parabolic illustrations

  5. **When in Doubt**:
     - Consult source language (Hebrew/Greek) demonstrative
     - Consider narrative context and physical proximity
     - Prefer natural target language expression
     - Avoid forced demonstrative choices that sound unnatural

# VALIDATION CRITERIA

validation_criteria:
  non_arbitrary_accuracy_required: "100%"
  rationale: |
    Non-arbitrary contexts (5-10% of total) have theological or critical
    contextual significance. Errors could:
    - Facilitate heretical readings
    - Confuse essential doctrines
    - Obscure narrative clarity

    Must achieve 100% accuracy on these high-stakes contexts before production.

  arbitrary_accuracy_target: "80%+"
  rationale: |
    Arbitrary contexts (90-95%) are stylistic. Target 80%+ accuracy to ensure:
    - Natural language flow
    - Consistency with translator choices
    - Avoidance of obviously wrong demonstratives

    Lower stakes allow some variation without theological risk.
