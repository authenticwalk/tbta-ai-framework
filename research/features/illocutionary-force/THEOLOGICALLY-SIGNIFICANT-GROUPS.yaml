feature: Illocutionary Force
default_classification: arbitrary
theological_significance: EXISTS
note: |
  Illocutionary force matters theologically primarily in specific contexts where the TYPE of speech act
  (command vs. permission, assertion vs. question, blessing vs. curse) affects doctrinal interpretation
  or ethical application. The VAST MAJORITY of utterances are arbitrary (narrative statements, historical
  questions, routine commands), but key passages require precision.

# SECTION 1: NON-ARBITRARY (Theologically Critical Contexts)
# ==============================================================================

non_arbitrary_contexts:

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # 1.1 DIVINE FIATS (Creation by Command)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'Genesis 1:3-27 (unverified) - Divine creative commands "Let there be..."'
    affected_values: [Jussive]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Creation ex nihilo (God speaks world into existence)
      - Divine sovereignty (God's word is performative, not merely descriptive)
      - Authority of Scripture (if God's commands create, Scripture's authority is absolute)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      JUSSIVE force (not declarative, not interrogative) is critical.
      "Let there be light" (Gen 1:3) is a PERFORMATIVE COMMAND, not a prediction ("there will be light")
      or question ("should there be light?"). The illocutionary force is constitutive of the doctrine
      of creation by divine fiat.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Jussive
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Declarative, Interrogative]
      theological_basis: |
        Hebrew יְהִי (yehi) is 3rd person JUSSIVE ("let there be"), not indicative future.
        God COMMANDS light into existence; He does not predict or question it.
      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Use target language's JUSSIVE/IMPERATIVE construction for 3rd person commands
        - Examples: English "let there be", Spanish subjunctive "haya", Japanese imperative あれ (are)
        - FORBIDDEN: Declarative ("there will be"), interrogative ("should there be?")
        - Stakes: Mistranslation to declarative = deism (God predicts, doesn't create by speaking)

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Declarative prediction ("Light will exist")'
        used_by: [Deistic interpretations]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED - Undermines divine performative speech, reduces God to observer

  # 1.2 TRINITARIAN COHORTATIVE (Genesis 1:26)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'Genesis 1:26 (unverified) - "Let us make man in our image"'
    affected_values: [Jussive]
    theological_stakes: CRITICAL
    affected_doctrines:
      - Trinity (Trinitarian dialogue vs. divine council vs. plural of majesty)
      - Christology (Is Christ included in "us"?)
      - Creation theology (Who participates in human creation?)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      JUSSIVE/HORTATIVE force (1st person plural "let us") is essential.
      NOT imperative (2nd person - God is not commanding humanity to create themselves).
      The COHORTATIVE form (Hebrew נַעֲשֶׂה na'aseh) indicates divine deliberation/collaboration.
      Changing to imperative or declarative loses Trinitarian implication.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Jussive
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Imperative, Declarative, Interrogative]
      theological_basis: |
        Hebrew cohortative (1st person plural volitional) = "Let us make".
        Orthodox interpretation: Trinitarian dialogue (Father, Son, Holy Spirit consulting).
        Imperative would imply God commanding someone external (angels? humanity?).
        Declarative would remove volitional/deliberative aspect.
      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: 1st person PLURAL hortative ("Let us...", "We shall...")
        - CLUSIVITY: If target language has inclusive/exclusive distinction:
          - Use INCLUSIVE (speaker + addressee) for Trinity (all persons participate)
          - NOT exclusive (would exclude Son or Spirit)
        - NUMBER: If target language has trial number (exactly 3), USE IT for Trinity encoding
        - FORBIDDEN: 2nd person imperative ("You make..."), declarative ("We will make...")

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Divine Council ("Let us" = God + angels)'
        used_by: [Jewish non-Messianic interpretation, some liberal Christians]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED - Angels do not create (Col 1:16 - Christ created all things)

      - interpretation: 'Plural of Majesty (royal "we", God alone)'
        used_by: [Some Jewish commentators, Rashi]
        christian_assessment: INSUFFICIENT - Possible but misses Trinitarian depth; NT reveals Trinity

      - interpretation: 'Polytheism (multiple gods consulting)'
        used_by: [Mormon/LDS theology]
        christian_assessment: HERETICAL - Violates monotheism (Deut 6:4, Isa 44:6)

  # 1.3 DIVINE COMMANDS vs. PERMISSIONS (Genesis 2:16-17)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'Genesis 2:16-17 (unverified) - "You may eat... but you must not eat..."'
    affected_values: [Imperative]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Human freedom (permission vs. command)
      - The Fall (Was eating fruit disobedience of command or abuse of permission?)
      - Divine law (negative vs. positive commands)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      DISTINGUISHING directive subtypes matters:
      - Gen 2:16: "You MAY freely eat" = PERMISSION (not command to eat)
      - Gen 2:17: "You must NOT eat" = PROHIBITION (command not to eat)
      Conflating permission ("you may") with command ("you must") distorts theology of freedom.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Imperative
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Declarative, Interrogative]
      theological_basis: |
        Both permission and prohibition use imperative forms in Hebrew, but with different nuances:
        - אָכֹל תֹּאכַל (akhol tokhel) - infinitive absolute + imperfect = emphatic permission
        - לֹא תֹאכַל (lo tokhel) - negative + imperfect = prohibition
        Both are DIRECTIVE force (imperatives), but different directive types.
      translator_guidance: |
        - Gen 2:16: Use PERMISSIVE imperative ("you may eat", "feel free to eat")
        - Gen 2:17: Use PROHIBITIVE imperative ("do not eat", "you must not eat")
        - Maintain distinction: Permission allows freedom; prohibition restricts it
        - Some languages grammaticalize permission (modal verbs "may", "can")

  # 1.4 BLESSINGS vs. COMMANDS (Genesis 1:28)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'Genesis 1:28 (unverified) - "Be fruitful and multiply"'
    affected_values: [Imperative]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM
    affected_doctrines:
      - Marriage and sexuality (Command or blessing?)
      - Birth control ethics (Is procreation obligatory or optional?)
      - Cultural mandate (Subduing earth - command or gift?)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      IMPERATIVE force is clear (Hebrew imperatives פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ pəru urvu "be fruitful, multiply").
      However, INTERPRETATION varies:
      - As COMMAND: Procreation is moral obligation
      - As BLESSING: Procreation is gift/enablement, not obligation
      Illocutionary force is imperative, but pragmatic function debated.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Imperative
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Declarative, Interrogative, Jussive]
      theological_basis: |
        Hebrew uses 2nd person plural IMPERATIVES (פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ).
        Christian orthodox views differ on interpretation:
        - Catholic/traditional: Command (procreation is purpose of marriage)
        - Protestant/moderate: Blessing-command (God enables and authorizes procreation)
        - Liberal Protestant: Primarily blessing (procreation optional)
      translator_guidance: |
        - USE imperative form (maintains Biblical text's illocutionary force)
        - Allow interpretive flexibility (notes can explain command vs. blessing debate)
        - Do NOT soften to declarative ("you will be fruitful") - loses directive force
        - Context: Follows blessing (1:27), so imperative may function as BLESSING-COMMAND

  # 1.5 RHETORICAL QUESTIONS (Teaching/Rebuke)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'Genesis 4:9 (unverified) - "Am I my brother''s keeper?" (Cain''s evasion)'
    affected_values: [Interrogative]
    theological_stakes: LOW
    affected_doctrines:
      - Human responsibility (Brother's keeper obligation)
      - Sin and evasion (Cain's guilt)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      INTERROGATIVE form (question syntax) but RHETORICAL function (implied assertion).
      Cain's question = deflection/denial, not genuine inquiry.
      Illocutionary force: Interrogative (form) but Declarative (function: "I'm not responsible").
      Not critical to doctrine, but affects interpretation of Cain's attitude.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Interrogative
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: []
      theological_basis: |
        Hebrew interrogative (prefix הֲ ha- implied or intonation).
        Rhetorical question expressing DENIAL/EVASION.
        Translation should preserve interrogative form (allows readers to discern evasion).
      translator_guidance: |
        - KEEP interrogative form ("Am I my brother's keeper?")
        - Do NOT convert to declarative ("I am not my brother's keeper")
        - Footnote may clarify: "Rhetorical question implying denial"
        - Some languages have rhetorical question particles (Korean -리요, Mandarin 呢)

  # 1.6 TEN COMMANDMENTS (Apodictic Law)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'Exodus 20:1-17 (unverified) - Ten Commandments "You shall not..."'
    affected_values: [Imperative]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Divine law (Absolute moral commands from God)
      - Ethics (Obligatory vs. advisory)
      - Authority of Scripture

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      IMPERATIVE force (prohibitions and commands) is ESSENTIAL.
      Weakening to declarative ("you will not...") or interrogative ("should you not...?")
      undermines absolute authority of divine law.
      These are APODICTIC commands (absolute, not conditional).

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Imperative
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Declarative, Interrogative, Jussive]
      theological_basis: |
        Hebrew לֹא (lo') + imperfect functions as PROHIBITION (negative imperative).
        "You shall not murder" (לֹא תִּרְצָח) is absolute command, not prediction.
        Imperative force = moral obligation, unchanging law.
      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Imperative/prohibitive forms ("You shall not...", "Do not...")
        - Maintain AUTHORITY and ABSOLUTENESS
        - Some languages use future tense with imperative force (Spanish "No matarás")
        - FORBIDDEN: Declarative future ("You won't murder"), interrogative ("Will you not murder?")
        - FORBIDDEN: Softening to suggestion ("It would be better not to...")

    non_orthodox_alternatives_awareness:
      - interpretation: 'Declarative predictions ("You will not murder" as consequence of faith)'
        used_by: [Some antinomian interpretations]
        christian_assessment: REJECTED - Reduces law to description, loses moral imperative

  # 1.7 JESUS' COMMANDS (Great Commission, etc.)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - verse_pattern: 'Matthew 28:19-20 (unverified) - "Go and make disciples..."'
    affected_values: [Imperative]
    theological_stakes: HIGH
    affected_doctrines:
      - Mission and evangelism (Command or option?)
      - Discipleship (Obligatory or voluntary?)
      - Church authority

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      IMPERATIVE force (Greek aorist imperative πορευθέντες poreuthentes "go",
      present imperative μαθητεύσατε mathēteusate "make disciples") is essential.
      This is the GREAT COMMISSION - authoritative command from resurrected Christ.
      Softening to suggestion ("Perhaps you could make disciples...") undermines missionary mandate.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Imperative
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Declarative, Interrogative, Jussive]
      theological_basis: |
        Greek imperatives (aorist participle πορευθέντες + aorist imperative μαθητεύσατε).
        Aorist = decisive action; present imperative = ongoing action.
        Christian orthodoxy: This is COMMAND from Lord, not optional suggestion.
      translator_guidance: |
        - REQUIRED: Imperative forms ("Go... make disciples... baptize... teach...")
        - Maintain AUTHORITY (Christ's command to church)
        - Some languages require politeness marking even for divine commands (Japanese -nasai, Korean -seyo)

    affected_values: [Declarative]
    theological_stakes: MEDIUM

      - Covenant theology (Promise vs. prediction)
      - God's faithfulness (Commitment vs. forecast)

    non_arbitrary_rationale: |
      DECLARATIVE illocutionary force, but FUNCTION varies:
      - PROMISE (commissive): God commits to future action
      - PREDICTION (assertive): God forecasts future event
      Promises create obligations; predictions merely inform.
      Theologically: God's "I will..." = PROMISE (covenant commitment), not mere prediction.

    christian_orthodox_position:
      preferred_value: Declarative
      acceptable_alternatives: []
      forbidden_values: [Interrogative, Imperative, Jussive]
      theological_basis: |
        Hebrew imperfect 1st person (אֶעֶשְׂךָ e'eskha "I will make you").
        Context: Covenantal promise (Gen 12:1-3 is Abrahamic covenant).
        Illocutionary force: Declarative (syntactic), but COMMISSIVE (Searle's taxonomy - promise).
        God's "I will" = performative promise, not prediction.
      translator_guidance: |
        - USE declarative form ("I will make you...")
        - PRESERVE promissory sense in target language:
          - Some languages distinguish promise from prediction (modal verbs, particles)
          - Japanese: します (shimasu) "will do" vs. 約束します (yakusoku shimasu) "promise to do"
        - CONTEXT MATTERS: Covenantal declarations = promises, not predictions

# SECTION 2: ARBITRARY (Stylistic/Contextual - No Theological Stakes)
# ==============================================================================

arbitrary_contexts:

  - pattern: "Narrative declaratives (historical statements)"
    rationale: |
      The vast majority of Biblical text is NARRATIVE DECLARATIVE: "Abraham went...", "David said...",
      "Jesus healed...". These statements convey historical fact; illocutionary force (declarative)
      is obvious and non-negotiable. No doctrinal implications from force choice.
    estimated_percentage: 70%
    examples:
      - "Abraham journeyed to Egypt" (Gen 12:10)
      - "David played the lyre" (1 Sam 16:23)
      - "Jesus wept" (John 11:35)

  - pattern: "Routine questions (information-seeking interrogatives)"
    rationale: |
      Most questions in dialogue are GENUINE INTERROGATIVES (not rhetorical): "Where are you going?",
      "Who is this?", "What do you want?". Illocutionary force (interrogative) is clear from context.
      No theological stakes in marking these as interrogative vs. something else.
    estimated_percentage: 8%
    examples:
      - "Where is your brother?" (Gen 4:9 - God's question, not Cain's rhetorical response)
      - "What do you seek?" (John 1:38)
      - "Who do you say that I am?" (Matt 16:15)

  - pattern: "Routine commands (non-theological imperatives)"
    rationale: |
      Many imperatives in narrative have no theological weight: "Sit down", "Bring me water",
      "Go to the city". These are mundane directives. Illocutionary force (imperative) is clear;
      no doctrinal implications from how forcefully they're translated.
    estimated_percentage: 10%
    examples:
      - "Bring me some game" (Gen 27:3)
      - "Fill the jars with water" (John 2:7)
      - "Go into the village" (Matt 21:2)

  - pattern: "Dialogue questions and responses (conversational interrogatives)"
    rationale: |
      Ordinary conversational questions between humans: "How are you?", "Where is he?", "When did
      this happen?". These are pragmatically straightforward; no theological nuance to illocutionary
      force choice.
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Descriptive speech (reported speech, quotations)"
    rationale: |
      Quotations of what people said: "He said, 'I am hungry'". The illocutionary force of the
      embedded quote is typically clear from context. No theological stakes.
    estimated_percentage: 5%

  - pattern: "Poetic/Wisdom literature non-theological assertions"
    rationale: |
      Much of Proverbs, Psalms (non-Messianic), Ecclesiastes consists of declarative assertions
      about life: "A gentle answer turns away wrath", "The sun rises and sets". These are declarative
      in force; no theological implication from force choice (though CONTENT may be theological).
    estimated_percentage: 2%

# ==============================================================================
# KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR TRANSLATORS
# ==============================================================================

translator_guidance_summary: |
  1. DEFAULT ASSUMPTION: Most illocutionary force choices are ARBITRARY (narrative flow, routine dialogue).
     Translators can use natural target language forms without theological concern.

  2. HIGH-STAKES CONTEXTS: Watch for:
     - Divine creative commands (Gen 1) - JUSSIVE force essential
     - Trinitarian references (Gen 1:26) - HORTATIVE/COHORTATIVE essential
     - Ten Commandments and divine law - IMPERATIVE force essential
     - Great Commission and Jesus' commands - IMPERATIVE force essential
     - Blessings vs. commands - context determines interpretation
     - Rhetorical questions - preserve interrogative form, note rhetorical function

  3. COMMANDS vs. PERMISSIONS: Distinguish carefully (Gen 2:16-17).

  4. PROMISES vs. PREDICTIONS: Context (covenantal vs. prophetic) affects interpretation,
     but illocutionary force remains declarative.

  5. INDIRECT SPEECH ACTS: Preserve surface form (interrogative) even if primary function is directive.

  6. TARGET LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS: Some languages MUST mark illocutionary force (Japanese, Korean,
     Mandarin particles). Don't assume English intonation-only approach is universal.
