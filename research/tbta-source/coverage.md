# TBTA Coverage Analysis

**Total Coverage**: 11,649 verses across 34 books (~37% of Bible)

## Books Covered

**Old Testament** (20 books): Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1-2 Samuel, 1-2 Kings, Jonah, Haggai, Zechariah, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, 1-2 Chronicles

**New Testament** (14 books): Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, 1-2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians

## Intentional Focus

TBTA deliberately prioritizes narrative and discourse-heavy books where cross-linguistic features (participant tracking, discourse genre, speaker demographics) matter most for translation. Books like Leviticus or Psalms have less coverage because linguistic features are more uniform or less critical.

## Coverage by Genre
- **Narrative**: ~8,500 verses (73%)
- **Epistolary**: ~2,000 verses (17%)
- **Prophetic**: ~800 verses (7%)
- **Other**: ~350 verses (3%)
