Add learnings here when V1 wins or discovers a new pattern.

---

## Verb Structure
- Avoid "have" with adverbial clauses; use existential "be" ("there was not enough food")
- Use `gave birth to` (NOT "birth" or "birthed")
- Use `sexed` not "slept with"
- Use `came to X` not `arrived at X`
- Use `lived` not `living`
- Passive → active: "was being prepared" → "someone was making" (Ac 10:10)

## Numbers
- Use numerals (2, 3, 10) not words — number words not recognized as adjectives

## Ambiguous Words
- Add `_noun`, `_verb`, `_adj` to clarify ambiguous words like "judges"
- CAUTION: "judges _noun" works but reference prefers just "judges" when context is clear (Ru 1:1)

- Never use "that" at start: `[God gave food...]` not `[that God gave food...]`
- Quote structure: `said, ["First sentence"]. Second sentence...`

- "give" with beneficiary → use "be kind" + "cause [to have peace]" (Phm 1:3)
- "believe/trust" cannot be intransitive, needs patient clause (Phm 1:5)

## Epistle Complexity
