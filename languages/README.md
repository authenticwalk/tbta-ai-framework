# TBTA Language Resources

**Purpose**: Document how TBTA features apply to specific language families and provide guidance for Bible translators working in 1,000+ languages.

**Dataset**: 1,009 languages across 70+ language families. Top 10 families account for 747 languages (74%).

## Language Family Adaptation Quick Reference

### 1. Austronesian (176 languages)
**Critical Features**: Inclusive/exclusive pronouns (obligatory ~170+ languages), Realis/irrealis mood, Dual number (Oceanic), Voice/focus systems (Philippine: 4 voices)
**Relevant Features**: Alienable/inalienable possession, Participant tracking, Reduplication
**Special Considerations**: Voice morphology differs in realis vs. irrealis; elevation-based deixis in some Oceanic languages
**Examples**: Hawaiian (dual + inclusive/exclusive + VSO), Tagalog (voice system obligatory), Tok Pisin (creole simplification)

### 2. Trans-New Guinea (129 languages)
**Critical Features**: Switch-reference + clause chaining, Evidentiality (14 Highlands languages), Dual number, Multiple past tenses (3-6 remoteness), Ergative case
**Relevant Features**: Serial verb constructions, Elevation-based spatial deixis (uphill/downhill/level)
**Special Considerations**: SOV universal; clause chains require participant tracking; evidentiality on final verb covers entire chain
**Examples**: Usan (switch-reference obligatory), Telefol (5-way evidential), Yupno (elevation deixis with temporal metaphor)

### 3. Indo-European (135 languages)
**Critical Features**: Case systems (Slavic: 6-7, Baltic: 7, Greek: 5), Aspect systems (Slavic perfective/imperfective), Dual number (Slovene only)
**Relevant Features**: Gender systems (3-gender Slavic/Greek/German, 2-gender Romance), Tense vs. aspect prominence, Negation (genitive of negation in Slavic)
**Special Considerations**: Conservative (Slavic/Baltic/Greek) vs. analytic (English/French/Persian) spectrum; Slavic best match for Greek grammar
**Examples**: Russian (6 cases, aspect-prominent, genitive of negation), Slovene (preserves dual), Hindi (split ergativity)

### 4. Niger-Congo (94 languages)
**Critical Features**: Noun class systems (3-25 classes, Bantu: 10-21), Tone systems (2-5 levels), Serial verb constructions, Aspect-prominent TAM
**Relevant Features**: Negation (double/triple in Bantu), Person/number marking, Agglutinative morphology (Bantu verb extensions)
**Special Considerations**: Noun class assignment affects entire translation (theological implications for God/Jesus/abstracts); tonal accuracy critical
**Examples**: Swahili (15-18 noun classes, non-tonal), Yoruba (3-tone system, serial verbs), Akan (serial verbs for instrumental/causative)

### 5. Otomanguean (69 languages)
**Critical Features**: Tone systems (UNIVERSAL, 2-5 levels for lexical + grammatical), Complex inflectional morphology, Aspect-oriented verbs, VSO word order
**Relevant Features**: Noun classifiers, Head-initial structure
**Special Considerations**: Tone is part of inflectional paradigm; low-resource technology underperforms; human validation critical
**Examples**: Zapotec (3-tone, VSO, aspect-prominent), Mixtec (tone + inflection interaction), Mazatec (tone distinguishes words)

### 6. Mayan (41 languages)
**Critical Features**: Ergative-absolutive alignment, Syntactic ergativity, Polysynthetic verb complex, Voice systems (passive, antipassive), Directional clitics
**Relevant Features**: Verb-initial word order (VOS/VSO), Complex TAM systems
**Special Considerations**: Set A markers = ergative + possessive; antipassive required for focus/question/relative constructions
**Examples**: K'iche' (ergative-absolutive, VOS, antipassive for extraction), Mam (polysynthetic verbs)

### 7. Australian (36 languages)
**Critical Features**: Ergative-absolutive case (split by person/animacy), Free word order, Paucal number (3-15), Kinship-influenced grammar
**Relevant Features**: Rich case systems (4-8 cases), Dual number (varies by kinship), Avoidance speech registers
**Special Considerations**: Word order serves pragmatics only; paucal range varies; kinship terms more specific than Biblical languages
**Examples**: Warlpiri (free word order, ergative-absolutive, paucal + dual), Pitjantjatjara (split ergativity, Western Desert kinship)

### 8. Afro-Asiatic (25 languages)
**Critical Features**: Root-and-pattern morphology (Semitic tri-consonantal), Grammatical gender (M/F), VSO word order (Semitic), Tone (Chadic/Cushitic, not Semitic)
**Relevant Features**: Gemination and vowel lengthening, Dual number (Classical Arabic, Hebrew paired body parts), Case systems
**Special Considerations**: Non-linear morphology; gender asymmetry with Greek; VSO natural in Semitic
**Examples**: Classical Hebrew (tri-consonantal, VSO, dual, construct state), Classical Arabic (root-and-pattern, 3-case), Hausa (2-3 tone, SVO)

### 9. Sino-Tibetan (18 languages)
**Critical Features**: Tone systems (2-9 tones), Classifier systems (obligatory for counting), Analytic grammar, Monosyllabic words, SOV vs. SVO
**Relevant Features**: Aspect systems (perfective/imperfective > tense), Serial verb constructions, Topic-comment structure
**Special Considerations**: Structurally diverse family; word order IS grammar in analytic branches; classifiers require semantic knowledge
**Examples**: Mandarin (4-tone, classifiers, SVO, topic-prominent), Burmese (3-tone, SOV), Limbu (polysynthetic, opposite of Chinese)

### 10. Quechuan (18 languages)
**Critical Features**: Evidentiality (3-term: -mi direct, -si reported, -cha inferred - OBLIGATORY), Agglutinative morphology, Bipersonal conjugation, Topic particles (-qa)
**Relevant Features**: SOV word order, Switch-reference (some varieties), Aspect systems
**Special Considerations**: Evidentiality cannot be left unmarked; agglutinative vs. Greek fusional; topic-prominent vs. subject-prominent
**Examples**: South Bolivian Quechua (3-term evidential, bipersonal, topic marking), Inga (regional variations)
