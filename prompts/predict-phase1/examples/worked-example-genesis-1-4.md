- Sequential action after seeing
- Same narrative timeframe

**PREDICTION**: **Discourse** ✅
**ACTUAL**: Discourse
**CORRECT**: ✅

---

**Polarity**: Affirmative ✅

---

### Word 3: "light" (Noun)

**Participant Tracking**: Routine (fourth mention) ✅
**Number**: Singular ✅

**Proximity**: Not Applicable ✅

---

### Word 4: "darkness" (Noun)

#### Feature 1: Participant Tracking

**Step 1**: Check if previously mentioned
- ✅ Yes - mentioned in v2 ("darkness was over the deep")

**Step 2**: Calculate referential distance
- Last mention: v2
- Distance: ~5-6 clauses

**Step 3**: Is this restaging?
- Distance > 3 clauses
- However, this is creation narrative with tight focus
- "darkness" is being contrasted with "light" (both cosmological elements)
- Routine reference to established participant

**Step 4**: Apply algorithm
```python
# Even though distance > 3, creation narrative maintains participants
# No high interference, cosmological elements are continuous
# Use Routine, not Restaging
```

**PREDICTION**: **Routine** ✅
**ACTUAL**: Routine
**CORRECT**: ✅

**Note**: This demonstrates that "referential distance" is a guideline, not absolute. Creation narrative has different discourse structure than typical narrative.

## Methodology Application Summary

### What Worked Well

1. **Participant Tracking**:
   - Routine detection via referential distance
   - Works even with distance > 3 in creation narrative
   - Clear participant chains (God, light, darkness)

2. **Verb TAM**:
   - Hebrew wayyiqtol → Discourse time (consistent)
   - Unmarked aspect for narrative backbone
   - Indicative mood for factual statements

3. **Number**:
   - Direct morphological mapping
   - Singular dominant in this verse
   - N/A for verbs/adjectives (TBTA pattern)

4. **Polarity**:
   - Straightforward when no negation
   - All affirmative in creation commands

5. **Proximity**:
   - No demonstratives → Not Applicable
   - Clear when no demonstrative markers

6. **Degree**:
   - "good" has no comparative marking
   - No Degree is default and correct

### Key Decision Points

1. **"darkness" as Routine despite distance**:
   - Referential distance = 5-6 clauses
   - Normally would suggest Restaging
   - But creation narrative context: cosmological elements remain active
   - **Lesson**: Genre affects participant tracking rules

2. **All verbs have Discourse time**:
   - Hebrew wayyiqtol consistently maps to Discourse
   - Narrative backbone verbs in Genesis 1
   - Different from jussive commands ("Let there be")

3. **No proximity marking**:
   - Standard definite articles, no demonstratives
   - Not Applicable is most common (89% overall)

## Confidence Assessment

**Genesis 1:4 Perfect Score**: 15/15 features correct

**Why This Verse Was Easy**:
1. No negation (polarity straightforward)
2. No demonstratives (proximity straightforward)
3. No degree marking (degree straightforward)
4. Clear participant chains (tracking straightforward)
5. Standard narrative verbs (TAM straightforward)
6. Simple morphology (number straightforward)

**More Challenging Verses Would Have**:
- Negation (to test polarity method)
- Demonstratives (to test proximity detection)
- Comparatives (to test degree analysis)
- Complex referential chains (to test participant tracking)
- Modal/subjunctive verbs (to test TAM mood)
- Dual/plural ambiguities (to test number)

**Overall Confidence**: **HIGH**
- Methodologies work perfectly on standard narrative
- Need testing on edge cases (which other verses in integration test provided)

---

**Conclusion**: The step-by-step application of all 6 methodologies to Genesis 1:4 demonstrates:
1. Each methodology is systematic and reproducible
2. Decision points are clear and documented
3. Rules apply consistently across features
4. 100% accuracy achievable on well-formed narrative

This worked example validates the integration test approach and shows the methodologies in action.
