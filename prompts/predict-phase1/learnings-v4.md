## Verb Case Frames
- `write` needs patient: "write a letter" not "write"
- `believe/trust` needs patient clause, not intransitive
- `give` patient-first: "give X to Y" not "give Y X"

## Quote Patterns
- Multi-sentence: split into `said,["S1."] said,["S2."]`
- Long quotes cause bracket-matching errors

## Epistle Complexity
- Dense passages need aggressive segmentation
- "fellow worker"→"work with I(Paul)"
- Greetings split into multiple sentences

## Narrative Structure
- `(title)` at section starts
- "One day" opener for narratives
- "decided [to verb]" for intent

## NT Markers
- `_paragraph` at section starts
- `(complex)/(simple)` for difficult concepts
- `_implicitActiveAgent` for passive agents

## Title Format
- OT narrative: `-Title X.` NOT `(title) X` (Gen 22:1)

## Deity Naming
- Genesis uses `God` (Elohim) not `Yahweh` (Gen 22:1)
- Only `Yahweh` when NIV has "LORD" (all caps)

## Call/Response Pattern
- "called X" → `seek-attention X. and X give-attention to Y.` (Gen 22:1)

## Sacrifice Vocabulary
- Explicit: `kill X` + `burn the body of X` (Gen 22:2)

## Saddle Pattern
- "saddled donkey" → `put a saddle on X's donkey` (Gen 22:3)

## Hyphenated Verbs (CRITICAL)
- ALWAYS base form: `pick-up`, `go-up`, `stand-up` (1Sa 17:40)
- NEVER past tense: ~~`picked-up`~~

## Proper Names
- Use `Goliath` not "the Philistine" when name known (1Sa 17:41)

## Deity Compounds
- "LORD Almighty" → `Yahweh-Almighty` (hyphenated) (1Sa 17:45)

## Simile Pattern
- `[like X verb Y]` for comparisons (1Sa 17:43)

## Hyphenated Prepositions
- `in-front-of`, `on-top-of` (1Sa 17:41)

## L2 Pairs
- "flesh" → `body/flesh` (1Sa 17:44)
